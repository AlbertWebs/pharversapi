It is hoped that this will fundamentally boost the country&rsquo;s fight against the scourge of HIV and AIDS.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>In July 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) published new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240054097\" target=\"_blank\">guidelines</a>&nbsp;recommending Cabotegravir (CAB-LA) to be offered as an additional option in HIV prevention to groups with significant risk to infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What is CAB-LA?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>CAB-LA is a long-acting injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) HIV medicine that has shown significant levels of safety and efficacy in prevention of HIV transmission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, 2 studies showed that the drug resulted in a 79% relative reduction in HIV risk compared with oral PrEP medication. This was largely attributed to the convenience in administration that enhances adherence through limiting stigma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, CAB-LA is administered twice in a space of 4 weeks and thereafter once every 8 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drug is patented by ViiV Healthcare, an institution born out of a partnership of drug powerhouses GSK, Pfizer and Shionogi- a pharmaceutical company from Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Late last year, Zimbabwe, through their regulatory body (Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe) became the first country in Africa to approve CAB-LA for use in its territory. Setting the pace for the rest of a continent that has more than 25 million people living with the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uganda is set to follow suit and have the drug available to its approximately 1.4 million citizens living with the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What was said?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr Daniel Byamukama, head of the HIV prevention division at the Uganda Aids Commission (UAC) stated that there were plans to roll out the drug at the onset of January 2024.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We have made orders using the Global Fund [HIV/Aids, Malaria and Tuberculosis] for injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). You take one injection every two months. If you are HIV negative you will not contract HIV,&rdquo; said Dr Byamukama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He further stated that the onus was on the National Drug Authority (medicines regulatory agency in Uganda) and other relevant institutions to expedite the necessary approvals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are sure all the national approvals will be ready by the end of this year and that injectable PrEP will be available for countrymen and women, starting January next year. It will be completely free of charge.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What&rsquo;s more</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://uac.go.ug/\" target=\"_blank\">UAC</a>, women are more disproportionately affected by HIV compared to men and children. As at December 2022, approximately 60% of persons living with HIV in the country were women while men and children accounted for 35% and 5% respectively. The same report also estimates that 17,000 people die every year in the country due to HIV-related illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Injectable PrEP has one advantage; that it is discreet. Most of the affected people are women. A woman carrying a box of oral PrEP pills is prone to violence from her partner. She is prone to being accused of promiscuity,&rdquo; Dr Byamukama said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For an injectable, you walk into the pharmacy or the hospital, you get one injection once in two months. That is quite discreet. Your husband or partner will never know about it so the controlling behaviour of sexual partners that always stop women from accessing these services will be addressed,&rdquo; he further stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are sure that after getting all necessary national approvals by end of this year, by January next year, people will have begun accessing for prevention. We are targeting all sexually active people who consider themselves at high risk. If you are married to a sex worker or your husband has multiple sexual partners; you are married to person who is HIV positive, and/or you are a sex worker&hellip;, it is safe and effective,&rdquo; Dr Byamukama added.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>More still needs to be done before the people of Uganda can benefit from CAB-LA. However, there is cause for cautious optimism in the nation that the drug will become a game changer in the fight against HIV in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, time will tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Did you find this insightful?

These losses range from high financial losses since expired medicines can no longer be distributed to high disposal costs involved.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the best practices that pharmaceutical players can put in place and help mitigate losses particularly during the pandemic', '<p><strong>Leveraging on data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both medicine dispensers and wholesalers need to have a systematic method of collecting data that relates to consumption of medicines. This involves investing in highly efficient inventory management software tools that are able to generate both individual and aggregate data that shall guide the procurement process. More formal drug utilization studies (DUS) can also be carried out to determine the rationality of this consumption. Demand forecasting has to always be guided by data otherwise drug warehouses shall be full of medicines that have no demand, leading to high storage costs and eventually vast financial losses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leveraging on Technology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evolution of artificial intelligence and more broadly technology has led to increased automation of operations and guided decision-making process. The health sector has greatly benefited from this since tools with predictive ability have been developed that inform the user on parameters such as reorder levels. These formulas would otherwise take the pharmacist hours and hours of calculation and recalculation to manually come up with. Some institutions have gone ahead and integrated their systems with suppliers such that an order is automatically sent to the supplier when reorder levels are reached. Companies should embrace automation since this reduces human error and accuracy of supply chain decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Know your drug ABCs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general majority of the effects (80%) are caused by 20% of the causes. This is the pareto principle and largely explains the ABC classification. Medicines in your organization can be categorized into three main classes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Class A medicines:</strong>&nbsp;represents 10-20% of your medicines that account for 50-70% of the cash budget</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Class B medicines:</strong>&nbsp;represents 20% of your medicines that account for 20% of the cash budget</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Class C medicines:</strong>&nbsp;represents 60-70% of your medicines that account for 10-30% of your cash budget</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Distributors, wholesalers, retailers and hospitals should focus on reducing inventory levels of Class A items rather focusing on more frequent purchases with reduced lead times. Efforts should also be made in securing lower cost per unit of Class A medicines</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Focusing more on FEFO than FIFO</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacies should institute First Expiry First Out (FEFO) medicine picking method rather than First In First Out (FIFO) to ensure optimization of the medicines shelf life. In this way medicines that have an earlier expiry are utilized first thus limiting the chances on expiry stock pile up. The medicine stores should be designed and built in a manner that allows implementation of this principle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Continuous improvement and capacity building</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pharmaceutical industry is a dynamic one, and as pharmacists it is important to update our knowledge on not only new trends of inventory management, but as well on new methods on improving our pharmaceutical supply chains.&nbsp; Administrators should ensure that the employees are regularly trained and retrained on these areas so they can sharpen their skills in this domain. &nbsp;Apart from that it is important to keep abreast with standard treatment guidelines to ensure that finances are not allocated to medicines that are not the standard treatment.</p>', '1', '7', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/pexels-tiger-lily-4481328-min-2-1200x800.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Image source:pexels', NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 11:57:43', '2024-06-19 11:57:43'),

It should be the goal of all supply chain managers to strike the right balance between demand and supply as this could have significant implications on overall success of the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An excess supply of medicines may mean high storage costs and financial losses due to expired medicines. Conversely, demand that exceeds available supply may mean loss of current and potential clients to your direct competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are 5 key principles that can improve accuracy of forecasts for pharmaceuticals.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Focus on demand rather than customer orders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a fine margin between what demand is and what customer orders are. The former refers to the medicines the customer is willing and able to purchase, while the latter is the actual quantity of medicines a client buys at a given period. Organizations should focus on actual demand rather than customer orders. This is because customer orders are influenced by a myriad of factors that may greatly distort the forecasting process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, a drug wholesaler may make an unusually huge order of Panadol tablets not necessarily because the dispenser&rsquo;s demand has increased but because he anticipates a shortage of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, a wholesaler may order a significantly lower amount of ibuprofen tablets just because the distributor is experiencing stock outs. In a third scenario, customer orders may be returned due quality issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on these reasons it is therefore not advisable to anchor forecasting on customer orders but rather on actual demand which can significantly differ.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Forecasts are almost never accurate</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, regardless of whether you use the most sophisticated statistical techniques or the most accomplished industry experts, forecasting is almost always inaccurate. During the course of doing business, circumstances and minds change which in turn affects buying decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As someone once said, the only thing constant in life is change and so is the demand for health products. Therefore, the goal is to just ensure that forecast errors are kept at a minimum through constant review of the forecasting techniques in use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some pharmaceutical companies make the mistake of basing their forecasts on their goals rather than the actual demand. This is a mistake as pharmaceutical forecasts should be based on data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Always include an estimate of error</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since forecasts are estimates, it is inevitable that some form of error may creep in during the forecasting process. Careful statistical analysis of the variability of demand should therefore be carried out to determine the error estimate (monetary terms).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a huge estimate of forecast error is detected, then it is advisable to review the forecasting steps. Alternatively, a restructure to accommodate the uncertainty of demand your medicines may be experiencing can be carried out.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Forecast pharmaceutical classes rather than a single drug</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmaceutical supply chain managers should focus on forecasting pharmacological classes rather than a single medicine. This concept of forecasting based on groups rather than single items is referred to as risk pooling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thinking is that, the low forecast items shall be offset by the high forecast items meaning the overall risk is lower than the average of all risks in the pool. For instance, it is better to forecast for antihistamines as a group rather than individually forecasting for cetirizine, there is less error that way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, one can as well pool risk by forecasting for a group of customers ordering the same item, rather than forecasting an individual medicine for an individual customer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Short-term forecasts are better than long-term forecasts</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Have you ever wondered why financial institutions charge more interest in long term loans rather than short-term ones? This is because in principle, long term plans are more prone to error since they are more likely to be derailed by chance and change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, someone who had a four-year demand forecast of certain classes of pharmaceuticals in 2018 may realize their numbers were inaccurate since they did not factor in the<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;COVID pandemic</a>. It is therefore advisable to do shorter-term forecasts and do appropriate forecast accuracy reviews to reduce estimate error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmaceutical supply chain managers are also encouraged to push for shorter lead times as this reduces the forecasting horizon and increasing accuracy of the forecast.</p>', '1', '7', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/pexels-alexander-isreb-1797428-min-3-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 12:00:55', '2024-06-19 12:00:55'),

In Kenya however there are great limitations', '<p>American senator&nbsp;<em>Bernie Sanders&nbsp;</em>once said that access to healthcare must be recognized as a right and not a privilege, I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Accessibility to quality healthcare and medication is the right of every individual and the responsibility of every Government to ensure that this is provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, in developing countries, despite the commitments made in the Abuja declaration of 1989, the health sector remains neglected and underfunded.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key&nbsp;<a href=\"https://extranet.who.int/nhptool/BuildingBlock.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">building blocks</a>&nbsp;of effective healthcare systems is access to high-quality affordable medical products, vaccines and technologies. &nbsp;This however for most patients remains to be a pipe dream as the realities of high cost and poor-quality medicines that have sipped into the pharmaceutical supply chains start to sink in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article I delve into 4 factors that affect access to quality medicines in Kenya and what can be done to improve the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://localhost:8000/uploads/ck/pexels-dazzle-jam-1046601-min-2-1536x1024_1718809349.jpg\" style=\"height:1024px; width:1536px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>High cost of medicines</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember once I met a patient who had walked in a hospital, got triaged, saw the doctor, got all the necessary laboratory and radiological investigations done, got a diagnosis and a prescription but left without a single medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for this was twofold; one was that the patient had spent all her money in the steps leading up to the full diagnosis, and two, the absolute cost of the medicines was way out of her reach. This is the reality for most poor Kenyans who are unable to afford lifesaving medicines and suffer in silence in their homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a presser, the former Kenyan Cabinet Secretary for Health, Mutahi Kagwe expressed that the government concerns on the current high cost of healthcare in the country and the need to regulate overall healthcare and by extension drug costs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, the government through the NHIF is trying to reduce the overall costs of healthcare and at the same time move the country&rsquo;s healthcare model from a largely out of pocket to a universal insurance model.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These efforts should be lauded and provide encouragement to other players to provide solutions to this ongoing crisis. It should be stated that encouraging generic prescription writing instead of brands could positively impact on cost of prescriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Substandard and counterfeit medicines</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Substandard medicines are those medicines which for one reason or the other have failed to pass the quality standards that have been set to allow their registration into a market. On the other hand, counterfeit medicines are those that have been intentionally and fraudulently been mislabeled. In both scenarios, these medicines are harmful to the patient as they could prolong hospital stays or even worse cause potentially fatal adverse drug reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics estimate that over 25% of medicines used in developing countries are substandard. Currently the Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) have tried to institute quality control guidelines through the National Quality Control Laboratory (NQCL) on introduction of pharmaceuticals into the market. Unfortunately, substandard and counterfeit medicines still find their way into the Kenyan pharmaceutical supply chain. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To solve these issues concerted efforts must be made by the industry players in the fight against poor quality medicines. The PPB should ensure all the quality tests are done and verified, pharmacovigilance reporting on poor quality medicines should be scaled up and feedback given in a timely manner and hefty fines imposed on those found deliberately engaging in this malpractice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Lack of resilient pharmaceutical supply chains</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resilience refers to the ability of pharmaceutical supply chains to return to a position of normal functioning after experiencing an event that causes operational results to deviate from expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When these events happen, supply chains are unable to find the right match of supply and demand and this could mean millions of patients not receiving their medicines. An example of this is the Covid pandemic whereby most supply chains (not just pharmaceutical industry) experienced a huge disruption of their normal operations due to the disease burden and a vast majority lost their lives due to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kenyan pharmaceutical supply chain players should increase resiliency by strategically increasing the number of response options and/or the time it takes to execute those options. Resiliency can be improved through risk monitoring and control. Pharmaceutical players should have disaster management plans that ensure continuity of pharmaceutical care with zero compromise on quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Patient perceptions</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The overall perception of patients when it comes to medicine use has been flawed by lack of information, cultural norms and lack of awareness. Many times, we hear of that aunt or uncle who when sick and diagnosed with an illness chose to engage in traditional, complementary medicines rather that conventional medicines. These traditional drugs end up harming and making their health deteriorate even faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As seen with the Covid vaccine whose uptake has been minimal at best, people get caught up in myths, conspiracy theories and half-truths on the legitimacy of the Covid vaccine. There has to be a cultural shift and increased awareness to encourage patients to use conventional medicines. Another aspect is the perception of health insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently the NHIF uptake among Kenyans stands at 20% and although this is double the figure from a few years ago, this still remains a concern. It is bare to see that most Kenyans have not really fully understood the benefits of health insurance and seem quite lethargic at the prospect of committing KES 500 monthly towards NHIF payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens is that medicines that would have been covered by the scheme have now to be bought out of pocket which poses a challenge to most Kenyans who largely live from hand to mouth. The Government should continue in earnest in educating the masses on the importance of health insurance and how this could make access to life saving medicines affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In summary the fight to increase accessibility to quality medicines for all needs collaboration between both the private and public sectors. Government should provide the right legislation on quality and cost of medicines and efficiently implement them; pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors should enhance an integrated quality management system to ensure distribution of quality medicines and patients should be informed on importance of quality medicines and health insurance.</p>', '1', '7', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/pexels-dazzle-jam-1046601-min-2-1536x1024.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 12:03:52', '2024-06-19 12:03:52');

It is therefore time that key players in the region strengthen the public health system through strategies such as enhancement of production of medicines and in essence boost self-reliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A region with approximately 1.4 billion people, Africa is home to only 375 drug manufacturing companies. Out of this figure, only 3 have the capacity to produce Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) while the rest focus on late-stage value addition; final formulation and packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to regions with roughly similar populations, such as China and India having 5,000 and 10,500 manufacturing facilities respectively, the continent is underperforming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why Produce locally?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More affordable medicines</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High cost of medicines has always been a huge impediment to quality healthcare in Africa. Ironically, for a region with a poverty rate of between 33-54% (sub-Saharan region) health is largely financed through out-of-pocket payments. With adequate production capacity and utilization, drug production in Africa can drop the cost of medicines to affordable levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The total cost of ownership of imported medicines is a figure that includes original cost of production, manufacturer&rsquo;s margin, taxes and freight costs to the distributor. All these components serve to push the landing costs to higher levels. If these products were to be manufactured locally at the same scale, there would be a massive drop in the freight costs and therefore effectively pushing the prices down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improved access to life-saving health products and technologies</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pexels-julie-viken-593451-1024x639.jpg\" style=\"height:639px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During drug importation, a substantial amount of time is lost during transportation, customs clearance and extra regulatory paperwork. This, in effect increases the time it takes for medicines to reach patients whose lives could be on the line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, events such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Suez Canal blockade of 2021 show that international logistics and supply chains are not completely fool proof. Local production of medicines in our view, has the potential to massively reduce lead times and protect patients against unreliable supply chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Favorable balance of trade</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With increased local production of medicines, African countries can move the needle and transition from being largely trade deficit to trade surplus nations. The resulting favorable balance of trade ensures that countries export more than what they import leading to increased inflow of foreign currency. Consequently, sparking economic growth and overall improved standards of living.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Increased levels of safe, quality and effective medicines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa has been grappling for decades with the challenge of counterfeit and sub-standard medicines in its market. A large contributor of this is the high costs of medicines that result in players seeking cheaper and more affordable poor-quality medication to meet its needs. Although not a silver bullet, local production coupled with strengthening of local regulatory bodies can substantially improve the quality of medicines in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How do we enhance local production?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Establish regional hubs that consolidate production</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/should-sub-saharan-africa-make-its-own-drugs\" target=\"_blank\">benefit</a>&nbsp;of local production of medicines can only be realized if the production capacities and utilization levels of manufacturing plants are of a large enough scale to compete with other markets like India. The current African pharmaceutical manufacturing space as it is, is highly fragmented. It is only through economies of scale that local medicine production can make health care affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Member states of blocs such as the East African Community (EAC) and South African Development Community (SADC) should consolidate resources to build big drug manufacturing plants that take advantage of economies of scale. As a group purchasing block such institutions can enjoy enhanced purchasing power and will be able to negotiate cheaper prices for raw materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Align laws, regulations and policies to promote local manufacturing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>With a 20% share of global supply, India is the number one single producer of generic medicines in the world. In addition, the country is the largest manufacturer of vaccines globally. The country has structured its policies in a way that favors local production of pharmaceutical products in an unimaginable scale. Africa can borrow from this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, countries can make a provision for 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDIs) under the automatic route for greenfield pharmaceuticals (construction of a pharma manufacturing plant from the ground up). For brownfield pharmaceuticals (utilization of an existing manufacturing facility and infrastructure) Governments can allow an automatic 70% FDI while the balance of 30% can go through an approval process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Governments can also enhance local production of medicines through redress of taxes on equipment and raw materials used in the manufacture of health products and technologies. Additionally, they can expedite time to market by cutting down on unnecessary bureaucratic procedures and incentivize local procurers &amp; insurance companies to prioritize purchase of locally produced products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Enhance human resource capacity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;A key component of a successfully enhanced local production venture is a human resource pool with the requisite knowledge and skills to spearhead the process. African universities need to restructure their pharmacy curriculum to ensure graduates are equipped with the skills that will develop the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 2014, 70 graduates from 8 African countries completed the Industrial Pharmacy Advanced Training (IPAT) at Kilimanjaro School of Pharmacy, Tanzania. As well, the University of Nairobi introduced a Master&rsquo;s program in Industrial Pharmacy. All these efforts lead the continent to the right path in enhancing the pharma manufacturing sector and should be replicated across other African universities that offer the pharmacy program.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Build strong partnerships and collaborations</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A key factor that has limited local production of medicines is trade-related intellectual property rights. It has been noted that African drug companies have struggled to negotiate with patent holder companies to gain licenses for innovator medicines, while this is granted to companies in other regions of the world. This is because such patent holders do not consider the market demand compelling enough to export their products to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of this is African patients are unable to access new innovative health products that could be a game changer to public health. It should be noted that so far, Africa has not shown ability to implement Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreements on exclusive and non-exclusive licensing.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;<em>Africa can no longer outsource the healthcare security of its 1.3 billion citizens to the benevolence of others</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<cite><strong>African Development Bank Group President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina</strong></cite></blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>African countries should ramp up their efforts to partner and negotiate with patent holding companies to allow manufacture of originator drugs through a win-win structural arrangement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strengthen the regulatory capacity and systems</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheaper but poor-quality medicines have sipped through the seams of weak regulatory systems in Africa. This has directly translated into treatment failures, increased morbidity and mortalities in the region. Drug regulatory agencies (DRAs) need to be adequately resourced financially, infrastructure-wise and in terms of human resource capacity so as to cope with proposed increased production. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, as at September 2020, there are only 9 WHO pre-qualified laboratories in the African region with the capacity of assessing quality of medicines in its market. This needs to be upscaled. State DRAs may also consider collaboration through aligning regulatory systems and create synergy and strength thereby enhance efficiency. Efforts are currently underway to harmonize regulatory systems in the region. The African Union has established a specialized health agency, African Medicines Agency (AMA) whose main task is to spearhead regulatory harmonization in the region. As at July 2023, 35 AU member states have either signed and/or ratified the AMA treaty. This would be similar to Europe where they have an integrated agency; European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that there are ongoing regional efforts to boost local manufacture of medicines in the continent. In 2007 for example, in an AU summit in Accra, AU heads of state and Government of the AU endorsed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://au.int/sites/default/files/pages/32895-file-pmpa_business_plan.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plan for Africa.</a>&nbsp;The vision is to develop a competitive and enduring integrated manufacturing pharmaceutical industry in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2022, the African Development Bank Board of Directors approved establishment of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/press-releases/african-development-banks-board-approves-landmark-institution-establishment-african-pharmaceutical-technology-foundation-transform-africas-pharmaceutical-industry-52727\">African Pharmaceutical Technology Foundation</a>.

They may contain the wrong active ingredient, wrong quantity of active ingredient or no active ingredient altogether.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What are the consequences?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Counterfeit medicines exert negative impact on both patients and pharmaceutical companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it can be imagined, taking a tablet of corn starch, potato starch or chalk thinking it is your regular dose of Amoxil can have dire consequences. Patients end up struggling with treatment failure, increased lengths of hospital stay, adverse drug reactions, antibiotic resistance, increased treatment costs or even death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is estimated that the cost of treatment for patients who have consumed counterfeit or substandard antimalarial medicines in sub-Saharan Africa lies between $12 million to $44 million dollars annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the flooding of counterfeits into the market, pharmaceutical companies have to cope with a tainted reputation on their brand and unimaginable losses in revenue. A report by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1181095/global-new-drugs-lost-due-to-counterfeit-drug-market/\" target=\"_blank\">Statista</a>&nbsp;approximated that pharma companies in 2020 lost approximately $200 billion in expected revenue to the counterfeit market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can be done?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leverage on track and trace technology</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key strategy in the fight against counterfeit medicines is serialization of packaging and labels. This ensures that all packages receive a unique ID that allows tracking and tracing as they navigate the pharma supply chain processes. Examples of these identifiers include the QR code, Radio Frequency Identification, 2D matrix code and holographs that capture key data points:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>a unique product identification code</li>\r\n	<li>manufacturing/import license number</li>\r\n	<li>a serial shipping container code etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pexels-kampus-production-7289717-1-1024x683.jpg\" style=\"height:683px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this strategy to be successful, it is important to align relevant laws, regulations and policies to require all pharma manufacturers and market authorization holders to have their products serialized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India, for example, approved a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rfxcel.com/india-track-and-trace-requirements/\" target=\"_blank\">regulation</a>&nbsp;requiring all imported and domestically manufactured Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) to be labelled with QR codes. This is required at all levels of packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>African countries can adopt the same strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ramp up reporting and information sharing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always looked at reporting of poor-quality medicines as a more reactionary than pro-active method of addressing the issue of counterfeit medicines. However, I also acknowledge the crucial role this activity plays in limiting the spread of negative effects that counterfeit medicines can have in a region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Constant and continuous sensitization on the importance of reporting of suspected poor-quality medicines should be the norm. Some countries have greatly focused on sensitization of health care workers which is a good thing. However, it should not end there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased effort should be turned towards training the public on how to identify and report on suspected counterfeit medicines. Once these reports are made, the relevant agencies should provide feedback so as to encourage future engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased collaboration among countries across the continent and global institutions such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://who-umc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Uppsala Monitoring Center</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/who-global-surveillance-and-monitoring-system\" target=\"_blank\">WHO&rsquo;s Global Surveillance and Monitoring</a>&nbsp;(GSM) system is a key success factor. The GSM for Substandard and Falsified (SF) medical products in particular undertake crucial activities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Improve reporting of SF medical products</li>\r\n	<li>Assess more accurately the scope, scale and harm caused by SF medical products</li>\r\n	<li>Provide immediate co-ordination and technical support in emergencies</li>\r\n	<li>Issue medical products rapid alerts</li>\r\n	<li>Gather and analyze a detailed body of validated evidence for Member States to enable evidence-based policy making and investment</li>\r\n	<li>Strengthen regional and national regulatory capacities to prevent, detect and respond to SF medical products</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Effort has been put towards enhanced reporting of poor-quality drugs and African countries like Kenya have established an online reporting tool (<a href=\"https://pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org/\">https://pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org</a>) to make the process more efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, more needs to be done to stamp out counterfeit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strengthen drug regulatory agencies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Drug regulatory agencies are the key departments concerned with compliance and investigative testing for medicines suspected to be counterfeit. These agencies are only able to execute their mandate through robust and well-resourced WHO pre-qualified quality control laboratories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality though, most African countries lack this key resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As at August 2023 there exists only 9 WHO prequalified laboratories in the region, majority of which are widely under- resourced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is absolutely vital to increase the number and capacity of these quality control institutions especially those heavily reliant on Government funding.

Considering most of medicine design happens in Europe, there is a huge disconnect in suitability and accuracy of drug treatment in the African population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/precision-medicine#:~:text=Precision%20medicine%2C%20sometimes%20known%20as,genes%2C%20environments%2C%20and%20lifestyles.\" target=\"_blank\">Food and Drugs Administration (FDA)</a>&nbsp;acknowledge, traditionally, formulation and manufacture of medicines has been for the &ldquo;average patient&rdquo;. This has worked to some extent but there is a cohort of patients who still struggle with the inaccuracies of dose and release profiles of these medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Long term, this innovative approach can create great gains in Africa, a region where cancer deaths are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/commissions/cancer-in-sub-Saharan-Africa\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a>&nbsp;to double to an estimated 1.4 million deaths annually by 2040. Precision medicine technologies that aids in rapid identification of tumor specific antigens from human leukocyte antigens can go a long way in enhancing treatment outcomes of individual tumors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additive manufacturing</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"African Pharma\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/pexels-karolina-grabowska-4021819-1024x683.jpg\" style=\"height:683px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another innovation that could completely change the overall outlook of Africa&rsquo;s pharma industry is additive manufacturing. This refers to where, instead of following the traditional models of manufacturing such as tableting, a 3D technology is used to stack and fuse layers of raw materials to form a medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key advantage of this technology is that manufactured medicines can easily be tailored for specific patients for instance through changing the release profile of the health product. This type of manufacturing complements the concept of precision medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another advantage is that this 3D technology can be placed at the hospital setting and when necessary, medicines can be printed/produced rather than relying on medicines with inaccurate doses and release profiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example is an FDA approved drug called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spritam.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Spritam&reg;</a>, which is a 3D printed anti-epileptic approved in August 2015. The profile of the drug, through additive manufacturing, is designed to immediately disintegrate after ingestion a feature that was made possible through 3D printing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, implementation of technology in the pharmaceutical industry is known to be notoriously slow. This is largely due to the size of investment involved and stringent laws and regulations that govern the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this should and cannot stop the continent in moving forward with ideas that could shape the overall public health of its citizens.

Because of the sheer complexities of these products (including insulin, infliximab and vaccines), it is natural that their GMP benchmark, approval, registration and overall regulatory processes would pose as a stumbling block to their production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>APTF has therefore launched the biosimilars program geared towards consolidating investments and creating technological partnerships that strengthen the capacity of African countries. One such partner that the foundation has successfully secured is the European Investment Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional Centers of Excellence Program:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation has created this program designed to increase learning through collaboration. Various institutions including universities, research centers, private companies and public sector will come together and create a network that facilitates capacity building across the region. This program is specifically targeted to yield a vibrant vaccine ecosystem that will allow self-reliance in production of safe, quality, efficacious and affordable vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cGMP program:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most African pharmaceutical companies are locked out of regional and international trade due to their inability to attain WHO recommended GMP compliance. Lack of requisite infrastructure, technology and personnel has meant that these companies are unable to play at the global league.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To alleviate this, APTF plans to first identify the specific gaps these companies are facing and thereafter facilitate the necessary investments to bridge them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>African Medicines Agency (AMA)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in February 2019, the African Union&nbsp;<a href=\"https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/36892-treaty-0069_-_ama_treaty_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Treaty</a>&nbsp;for the establishment of the African Medicines Agency was adopted in the 32nd&nbsp;ordinary session decision of the Assembly Heads of State and Government.

Currently, it is estimated that only 3% of the pharmaceutical commodity needs are met through intra-African trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>97% is either imported or locally produced but not traded within the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In steps the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AfCFTA_SECRETARIAT_LOGO-copy.jpg\" style=\"height:354px; width:850px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: AU-AfCFTA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AfCFTA is a free trade area that canvasses most of the African region. It is, in fact, the largest free trade area in the world by virtue of the number of countries in the pact8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://au.int/sites/default/files/treaties/36437-treaty-consolidated_text_on_cfta_-_en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">African Continental Free Trade Area agreement</a>&nbsp;that came into force in May 2019, currently has 54 AU member states as signatories and is expected to be a landmark covenant that changes the face of Africa&rsquo;s economic landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agreement is seen as an opportunity to lift 30 million people in the continent out of extreme poverty and increase income of 68 million others who live on less than $5 a day1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main objective of AfCFTA is to enhance trade within the African continent specifically in value added production including that of health products and technologies. In fact, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Friends_of_the_Africa_Continental_Free_Trade_Area_2023.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">World Economic Forum report</a>&nbsp;has earmarked the pharmaceutical sector as a key potential beneficiary of the agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This opens a huge door of possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the increased ability to freely trade within the region, it is expected that local pharmaceutical manufacturers will be able to supply the continent with products at more reasonable prices. Progressively, this will allow companies to penetrate the regional market and eventually grow into a formidable competitor. Particularly against international counterparts that have historically dominated the African market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other benefits to the African pharmaceutical market could include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Enhanced capacity of local companies to supply the international market.</li>\r\n	<li>Strengthened regional pharma supply chains.</li>\r\n	<li>Improved regional coalitions that will increase the continent&rsquo;s purchasing power of raw materials in the manufacture of medicines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With operationalization of the AfCFTA, measures to enhance trade that simplify unnecessary bureaucratic and customs processes are expected to translate to a $450B jump in income in Africa by 20358.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the secretariat sits in Accra, Ghana, it is hoped that this agreement will alleviate some of the continent&rsquo;s overreliance on foreign economies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenges that are faced in the African pharmaceutical sector are many. However, no one can argue that the potential is there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As shown by the 3As, innovation and collaboration remain key in the continent&rsquo;s ability to harness its potential and finally become a formidable source in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful challenge that will need all African countries to pull together, establish political goodwill and consolidate resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may not all happen in 2024 but the hope is that it will be a launching pad on which we achieve the dream of having a robust, dynamic and self-reliant African pharmaceutical industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will it happen?

Global pharma companies operating in the continent need to have solid dollar cash flows to be able to import raw materials as well as repatriate revenue earned in these African countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last 5 years alone, the Naira has diminished in value from 361 to 1250 (as at 5th&nbsp;Feb 2024) in relation to the dollar. This means revenue earned in the local currency loses a significant portion of its value immediately the company elects to import more raw materials to aid production or take money back to their home countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European global pharma corporations have also had to deal with fierce competition from Indian and Chinese pharmaceutical companies that are able to supply the continent with generic medicines at a fraction of the cost of the brand alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, companies like GSK and Bayer have had to rethink their strategies so as to retain and even expand their current market share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With skyrocketing costs of production, these companies have found it difficult to maintain affordable prices. A situation that spells irony considering the end goal of pursuing local production was to avail medicines at a more affordable unit cost to the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Electricity price in Kenya has for example ballooned by 63%. This, accompanied with a raft of increased taxes; doubling of VAT on fuel, introduction of housing levy, increase of statutory deductions, makes it almost untenable to manufacture locally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Security concerns, political instability and uncertainties around policies are other reasons why pharma companies may be ceasing operations and migrating out of the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, is outsourcing necessarily a bad thing?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, short answer; no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outsourcing is neither nothing new nor always a sign of impending doom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As far back as the 1970s, manufacturing companies used to contract outside firms to manage their non-core processes with the overall goal of improving efficiency. In fact, research has shown that outsourcing can improve productivity and competitiveness 10- to 100- fold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contracting out non-core functions of a company is therefore not solely about saving costs, it is a key strategy that some say will power the 21st&nbsp;century global economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/store-5619201_1280-1024x682.jpg\" style=\"height:682px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of outsourcing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ceding control of logistics (warehousing and transportation) function allows companies like GSK and Bayer to focus on what they do best; research, development and manufacture of medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contracted company whose core competency is distribution, is more likely to deliver more efficient services as compared to the pharmaceutical-focused companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the change in strategy to outsourcing, it is natural selection that the workforce would inevitably lose their jobs and would need compensation for their release &ndash; costing companies millions of dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not be the case if the company had outsourced to a third-party logistics provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is more human resource flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A company like GSK for example, would find it easier to contract or drop a logistics company for its functions rather than going through the processes of human resource hiring and firing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Risks of outsourcing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pharmaceutical company that elects to handover its logistics functions to a third party has essentially given up control of one of its important business component.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the structure of the contract the company may find it difficult to be fully involved in crafting and implementation of the distribution strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases when a logistics company is contracted to take over the distribution aspects of the business, they in most cases, do a great job. However, there are those odd scenarios where the contracted company, for one reason or another could be less efficient than the pharmaceutical company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not understanding the concept of outsourcing, clients may perceive this as a drop in performance of the parent company therefore resulting in loss of business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/formula-1-2701335_1280-1024x763.jpg\" style=\"height:763px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As seen, the decision to transition to a third-party distributor led model, whether calculated or forced, has its strong points and is not averse to risk. It is not unfathomable that more global pharmaceutical companies will decide to adopt the same strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is it a good thing or a bad thing?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Context provides more clarity on where the answer lies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we can&rsquo;t hide the fact that rising operational expenses, economic downturns, security concerns and questionable policies are hurting the African pharmaceutical business environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With continental efforts shifting more towards self-reliance in terms of increased local production of health products.

And there are risks in over relying on a single source; hence, many agencies have elected to use a combination of the three rather than solely relying on one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of the source, for an NRA to achieve maturity level 3 (ML3), it has to establish clear sources of funding that will allow it to adequately finance its budget and perform its mandate in a stable and sustainable manner.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure this is achieved, African countries should ensure that sources of funds for NRAs are ring-fenced through government policy, legal frameworks, and updated fee systems.4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Define clearly the amounts collected for fees, taxes, tariffs or dues payable and make them public</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The amounts charged for services offered by the NRA should neither be ad hoc nor a secret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory authorities need to establish a clear and concise document that indicates the exact fees, taxes, tariffs, or dues payable. This provides clarity, structure, and guidance to companies seeking to register a medical product, conduct a clinical trial, or set up a manufacturing plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making these fees public also fosters a culture of transparency and predictability, allowing for scrutiny and audits and ensuring the proper channels are taken to collect all charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No regulatory authority can achieve WHO ML3 without defining all their fees as well as making this information available to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important to note: fees don&rsquo;t have to be consistent with a pre-set universal standard fee. In fact, studies have shown great variability in the amounts charged for the different services offered by different NRAs.4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regulatory fees charged by NRAs are ideally proportional to the market size of their jurisdictions.5&nbsp;So, whatever the rates may be, the agency should just ensure that they are well defined and accessible to all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Establish provisions relating to reduction or exemption of fees and other charges in defined situations for public health interest</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main role of the NRA is to facilitate, as opposed to being a barrier to accessing safe, effective, and quality health products by the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a medicine regulator to show true maturity, it has to have mechanisms in place that prioritize public health and safety through exemptions during times of outbreaks, shortages, and emergencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The importance of these provisions was highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, as the world grappled with the new wave of deaths that swept across the globe, there was an urgent need for commodities such as ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), testing kits, and vaccines, whose consumption superseded their availability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major NRAs invoked their exemption clauses, allowing these lifesaving commodities (which were in extreme shortage at the time) to be fast-tracked during their registration and approval processes.6</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This move saved many lives and laid the foundation upon which many countries were able to contain the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the bare minimum for an NRA hoping to achieve level 4 maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The NRA has authority to manage the funds allocated and/or generated internally</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the core of any national medicine regulatory authority is its ability to remain independent, autonomous, and unbiased in executing its mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How it spends the income it generates or allocates through different budget lines should be an internal activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not always the case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In certain countries, income generated by NRAs is rerouted to the respective ministries, who dictate how the money should be spent. In turn, crippling some of the initiatives that may have been prioritized by these institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the agencies are more in touch with the unique needs that they face, it is important, through legislation, policy, or otherwise, to gain authority to decide how to spend the allocated or internally generated funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s only through this that NRAs can be in contention to achieve maturity level 4 and be able to ensure that key issues with regards to regulatory oversight are prioritized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The regulatory body should periodically publicize its budget</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask key stakeholders, including NRA employees, how their annual budget looks, and half (maybe more) have no clue about the budget lines or contents therein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is by no means a fault of their own, since in most institutions, budgets are the purview of only a select few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the right practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"WHO Maturity levels 3 and 4\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-4-1024x576.jpg\" style=\"height:576px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory authorities that are striving to achieve maturity level 4 need to publicize their budgets, clearly indicating how much they intend to spend on the priority areas of regulation and oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure this occurs on a consistent basis, there should be legal provisions in place mandating these institutions to periodically publicize their budgets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This creates transparency and trust towards the authority and attracts the necessary support for their activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When NRAs are not operating at their optimum, countries lose revenue, or worse, lives, as substandard and falsified medicines start to creep in through regulatory loopholes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is therefore vital for governments to ensure that these agencies are well funded and are granted the autonomy to drive the safe, quality, and effective medical products agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the day, financing on its own may not be enough to achieve WHO maturity level 3/4, but it is certainly a key facet and starting point in strengthening the national regulatory systems and public health in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find this informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>', '1', '11', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Blog-Banner-for-Website-Content-6-1536x864.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, 'Rwanda Food and Drug Authority Offices (Source: rwandafda.gov.rw)', NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 12:29:10', '2024-06-19 12:29:10'),

How can it be done in a sustainable manner?', '<p>The topic of enhanced local pharma manufacturing in Africa is one that has divided opinions, to say the least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One faction remains adamant that the key to unlocking the full potential of the sector is by developing self-reliance through local manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the other questions the feasibility of the entire thinking, highlighting that Africa has neither the political goodwill nor the consolidated market size to reap the real benefits of local manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of where you stand, one thing we can all agree on is that there&rsquo;s huge potential and room for improvement in equal measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa&rsquo;s vulnerability and over-reliance on foreign imports were ruthlessly exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, where the continent struggled to match its medical product needs with the needed supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The continent depends heavily on foreign players to meet its pharmaceutical needs, with imports accounting for 70% &ndash; 90% of its total consumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In comparison, countries like China and India, with similar population sizes (approximately 1.4 billion), import only 5% and 20%, respectively.1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa also imports an estimated 99% of its vaccine needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 2022, only 20 African countries have drug manufacturing capacities, most of which have limited or no scope for R&amp;D and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>80% of total production on the continent is carried out in only 8 countries in Africa.2</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>So, the question is, why bother to increase local production?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a report by the African Development Bank, there are three levels of impact that local production of pharmaceuticals could have: economic, health, and strategic.2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic impact</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who support the idea of enhanced local production argue that it could have a significant impact on African countries&rsquo; economic positioning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They point to an improved trade balance, GDP growth, and job creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last few years, it has become abundantly clear that there&rsquo;s a gaping trade deficit due to the huge shortage of foreign exchange in some African countries. With low amounts, say of the dollar, it becomes extremely difficult to do business, especially when you rely on raw material importation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, increased quality production of medical products could result in increased exports, translating to an influx of foreign exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The argument for GDP growth is attributed to the increased levels of business and the creation of an &ldquo;economically viable industrial base&rdquo; that ultimately contributes to larger economic growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Opening new industries as well creates job opportunities for a diverse professional pool: regulatory affairs professionals, pharmacists, microbiologists, researchers, machine operators, managers, and many more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not everyone subscribes to this way of thinking.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2019 report by McKinsey &amp; Company indicated that although increased local production in sub-Saharan Africa could have a significantly positive effect on the balance of trade, the report argues that the impact on GDP and job creation would be negligible at best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The explanation is that the pharma sector is not big enough in the overall scheme of things to truly have an effect on GDP growth, and with the recent inclination towards automation, the number of jobs created would also not be considerable.1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public health impact</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impact of local production of medicines on public health could be profound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the region has struggled to gain access to newer, innovative health products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is largely because the larger foreign pharmaceutical companies, which are the main patent holders, have not found the highly fragmented African market to be attractive. It is a huge ask to register these products across the individual African countries whose regulatory processes are not harmonized, leaving public health at a huge disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local production could provide a solution to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the manufacture of quality generic products, Africa can realize the benefits of newer products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of local manufacturing could have a ripple effect on the relevant country&rsquo;s regulatory system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The national medicines regulatory authority will need to step up its efforts to ensure the companies manufacturing locally are strictly sticking to the recommended procedures, guidelines, and standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The authority therefore, in itself, will have to build its own capacity, leading to safer, better-quality, and more efficacious medical products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Supply security impact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving levels of local production ensures that the continent doesn&rsquo;t over-rely on foreign imports to meet its pharmaceutical needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmaceutical supply chains are not fool-proof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&rsquo;s the COVID-19 pandemic, the Suez Canal blockade, or Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, there are unexpected events that can abruptly halt the importation of pharmaceutical products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just relying on imports is therefore not a lasting solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local production ensures that in times of such events that create uncertainty, it can still be able to sustain health service delivery to its citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can local production of pharmaceuticals in Africa be made more feasible?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Improve the quality of manufactured products</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa has had to contend with the influx of substandard medicines on its market, some of which have been locally produced.4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, patients have struggled with therapeutic inefficiencies, increased hospital stays, antimicrobial resistance, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to combat this is by stepping up quality through cGMP compliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensuring that only international standards of quality are achieved ensures that these products are able to access a large enough market size both regionally and globally to be able to manufacture sustainably for the long haul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no longevity in producing poor-quality medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continentally, key players such as the African Union have recognized the urgent need for harmonizing medicine regulation in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence, the emergence of the African Medicines Agency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A harmonized regulatory framework allows the strengthening of NRAs across the region, allowing for good-quality, safe, and efficacious medicines in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Improve production volume and efficiency</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main aspects many look at when assessing the benefits of local production is its effect on affordability. Many argue that ultimately, medicines need to be more affordable to truly have a lasting positive impact on public health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affordability is realized through economies of scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a large enough production capacity that ensures efficiency and decreases the cost per unit of medical product produced is the first step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next objective will be to ensure that utilization rates are maximized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many African countries struggle with inconsistencies in the supply of water and electricity, two elements key in the manufacturing process. Additionally, they struggle with infrastructure and logistical challenges limiting the companies&rsquo; ability to achieve continuous manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has to change if local production is to be feasible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased production capacity and utilization rates of manufacturing plants will lead to an improved production volume, allowing companies to produce at lower costs and eventually availing of medicines at competitive prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otherwise, many will still lean towards cheaper imports if locally sourced products are expensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Create synergy through the creation of industry clusters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The smaller African countries may not be able to engage in local production of pharmaceuticals, especially if this is targeted just for their own markets.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not in a sustainable way anyway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why efforts have to be turned towards creating and taking advantage of regional hubs. The East African Community (EAC), for example, can bring together its eight members to create an industry cluster that supports the production and supply of medical products within the whole community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same can be done for the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which can pool resources to create another industry cluster, improving capacity and targeted market size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making substantial technology investments</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa struggles to access key technologies needed in drug discovery and development, which is the main reason why many countries struggle to establish API manufacturing sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their paper, Kaplan and Laing indicate that there&rsquo;s no point in engaging in local production of medicines if countries will still end up buying APIs at higher costs than their foreign counterparts, making locally produced medicines more expensive.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For local production to work, Africa needs to invest in the requisite technologies that will ensure API production capability, improved manufacturing efficiency, and better quality of final products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Creating incentives to support local production</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s little that can be achieved regionally without political goodwill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>African countries need to step up and show commitment and support for local production to be achieved. Laws, policies, and regulations have to be structured in a manner that supports this initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laws that prioritize public procurement of locally produced medical products, tax breaks, and eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy without compromising on quality could ensure the sustainability of local manufacturing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries can also take advantage of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://au-afcfta.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AfCFTA agreement</a>, where member countries are committed to eliminating tariffs on most goods and services over a period of 5, 10, or 13 years, depending on the country&rsquo;s level of development or the nature of the products.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Just like many other regions in the world, Africa can reap the benefits of local production of pharmaceuticals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, this is contingent on intentional efforts by governments to express political goodwill and create a business environment that fosters and encourages investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key lies in consistency in commitment, collaboration, and public-private partnerships within the continent to manufacture in a sustainable manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will this happen within a year?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can it happen eventually?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many have proven it can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over to you, Africa!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find this informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evaluating the sub-Saharan African pharmaceutical market | McKinsey.

This initiative is aimed at understanding the variable genetics on the African continent and the impact they have on variable response to medicines in African populations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Changing the DNA of therapeutics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Chibale and his co-authors&rsquo; inquiries were driven by the understanding that drug research and trials often fall short both at the clinical and preclinical phases, resulting in the development of medicines that aren&rsquo;t necessarily fit for treating African patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today, Africa makes up 15% of the world&rsquo;s population, but carries 20% of the global disease burden. Although we have this scenario, medicines haven&rsquo;t historically been optimised for the African patient population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is partly because there has been a very low volume of clinical trials on the continent. On average, about 3 to 4% of global clinical trials happen in Africa. This means, by implication, that the therapeutics coming out of these trials are optimised largely for people from the developed world or at least outside of Africa,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today, Africa makes up 15% of the world&rsquo;s population, but carries 20% of the global disease burden.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Even before those investigations, however, preclinical trials that study how we metabolise specific drugs, use tools &ndash; for example, liver cells containing drug metabolising enzymes &ndash; from Caucasian donors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;No livers from African donors are used in the conventional discovery process, the absence of which means that the predicted dosages in clinical trials do not account for the massive genetic variation that we know exists in the African population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Genetic differences in the expression and activity of drug metabolising enzymes and transporters ultimately result in variable responses to therapeutic drugs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this vein, Project Africa GRADIENT is critically important, not only for driving the development of therapeutics that are effective in treating diseases, but also optimising the dosage that patients receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Project Africa GRADIENT is an initiative to begin to understand what the impact is of this huge genetic variability that exists in Africa in terms of our response to medicines,&rdquo; Chibale added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fast-tracking medical research with AI</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, collecting the data required to advance a study like this on the African continent has been challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, AI presents an opportunity for researchers to use the limited data they have at their disposal to build models that can effectively predict the potential outcomes of therapeutic treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the context of the Project Africa GRADIENT initiative, H3D in collaboration with Ersilia Open Source Initiative (EOSI) have been using AI to identify genetic variants that are prevalent in Africa and likely to affect the metabolism of malaria and tuberculosis&nbsp;(TB) drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These genetic variants of interest are being incorporated in existing mathematical models to come up with proposed tailored dosages, which need to be evaluated in ethnobridging human clinical trials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;AI has a lot of potential to accelerate medical research in Africa.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;AI has a lot of potential to accelerate medical research in Africa, but there are several barriers for the realisation of its full potential, including access to affordable power or electricity, connectivity or digital infrastructure, and data,&rdquo; Chibale said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When it comes to data, you need rich, highly intensive, granular data to do these types of analyses. Unfortunately, this has been lacking on the African continent. There hasn&rsquo;t been effective collection of data and there is little access to the data &ndash; especially in a format that allows us to use AI and ML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;However, because of the potential impact of this research, we can&rsquo;t wait until we have all the data that we need. So, the approach that we&rsquo;ve taken is to recognise that there is some data that we can work with and then to use transfer learning from other areas to leapfrog over this obstacle.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the director of H3D, this is something that African researchers must take advantage of. In this instance, it&rsquo;s not only the synthesis of more appropriate therapeutic treatments, but also ensuring that Africa can capitalise on these research methods that should be a motivating factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning to see applications of AI in almost every sector of society, but we are already seeing that we are lagging behind. Unfortunately, if we are not careful, this chasm that has begun to develop between Africa and the rest of the world will continue to grow and we will be left behind,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The future depends on African innovation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With myriad challenges to overcome &ndash; think access to electricity and internet services along with inadequate data collection &ndash; Chibale noted that it&rsquo;s essential that African scholars lead the way in this research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is a very strong link and correlation between the genetics of the population, the social and physical environment in which those patients live, and treatment of disease. Therefore, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer, that doing the discovery and the development in close proximity to where the patients are is a better way to address unmet medical needs of those people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Without understanding the social and physical environment in which these patients are and the researchers understanding the communities that they&rsquo;re going to be serving, innovation will be pointless,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The disease burden falls largely on the shoulders of Africans. It&rsquo;s mostly us, so this will likely not be a priority for other countries or regions; we must take matters into our own hands to secure a better future on our continent.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is no question that we as Africans have been beneficiaries of the health innovation that has taken place in the developed world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, Chibale highlighted that innovative contributions to research can help Africa to take its place on the global stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is no question that we as Africans have been beneficiaries of the health innovation that has taken place in the developed world in terms of the discovery and development of innovative medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We must now contribute something in this area as we have been doing in other areas as exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.

pregabalin</strong>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key motivator for those who abuse pregabalin is a feeling of euphoria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, studies have shown that those who take the drug for recreational purposes have been quoted as describing the feelings they experience as sedation, dissociation, relaxation, contentment, numbness, uninhibited behavior, improved sociability, empathy, or audio/visual hallucinations.3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other studies have shown that many misuse pregabalin by self-medicating with the intention of fighting anxiety or managing pain.4</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has also been reported to be used to heighten the effects of other substances, such as opioids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Effects of misuse</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregabalin carries a risk of dependence, an aspect that may introduce the classic addiction-related issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, drug-drug interactions, particularly with medicines such as methadone or morphine, could lead to death due to breathing complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at the numbers in England, Scotland, and Wales, for example, there were a total of 808 deaths related to pregabalin in the year 2022 alone.5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia had 824&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.penington.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/PEN_Annual-Overdose-Report-2023_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">deaths</a>&nbsp;related to the same drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are an estimated thousands of unreported deaths globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Legislation/Regulation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared to the US and some European countries where pregabalin has been listed as a high-risk potent drug in their laws, the case is not the same as in the Niger and other African countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means the handling and distribution of this drug are not under stringent guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to this circumstance, traffickers are able to evade domestic laws, and it is more challenging for law enforcement to look into and apprehend those involved in the trafficking of pregabalin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pregabalin is a key medicine, and doctors would argue that it can&rsquo;t be completely eliminated from standard therapy. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean stakeholders should sit idly by as actions that promote misuse and abuse thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trafficking of this medicine as well as pharmaceutical opioids is both a global and African problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is therefore important to implement strategies that will limit the enablers of this practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UNODC report highlights corruption and money laundering as the main enablers of this practice, as well as the lack of proper laws that would inhibit misuse and abuse of the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be time to step up efforts in the fight against pregabalin trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost as much as that exerted in the fight against cocaine, cannabis, and opioid trafficking.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Do you find this insightful?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://subscribers.africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/public/login\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>References</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyrica (pregabalin) dosing, indications, interactions, adverse effects, and more.

The Fidson consortium is also planning manufacturing some APIs.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The DG said the initiative was aimed at reducing the cost of drugs eventually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;But we cannot start manufacturing locally without strengthening the regulatory because we have never regulated local manufacturing of APIs.&rsquo;&rsquo;, she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>High cost of medicines creating an avenue for substandard products</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prof. Adeyeye has acknowledged how inaccessibility to safe, quality, efficacious, and affordable medicines could be a breeding ground for substandard and falsified (SF) medicines. And how the authority will not rest in its laurels while unscrupulous businessmen thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our work is 24/7 in terms of regulation and control of SF medicines. We do unannounced inspections of local manufacturers. Since, February 16 and 17 this year we went after the Open Drugs marketers because some of the unscrupulous manufactures or importers use the open market as haven for substandard falsified medicines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We will be using Traceability technology to monitor the supply chain. NAFDAC is leading in Africa and second in the world using Track and Trace technology,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Will these initiatives be enough to boost local manufacturing of health products in Nigeria?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Time will tell.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Did you find this informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://subscribers.africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/public/login\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>', '1', '10', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/20240508_112538_0000-1.png', NULL, 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/audio/untitled-2.mp3', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 12:42:07', '2024-06-19 12:42:07'),

Furthermore, the prevalence of substandard and falsified drugs has made the situation worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there has been a concerted effort to boost local pharmaceutical production, questions about feasibility remain a significant obstacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary argument for local production is the potential cost savings from reduced transportation expenses and customs fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, as noted by Warren Kaplan and Richard Laing in their paper &ldquo;Local Production of Pharmaceuticals,&rdquo; if a developing country imports active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) at high costs, local production may not lead to significantly lower prices for the end products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, merely shifting to local production without addressing the cost of raw materials might not improve access to affordable medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Benefits of Pooled Procurement</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pooled procurement offers several significant benefits for African countries in their quest to improve access to affordable and high-quality medicines:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Increased Purchasing Power:&nbsp;</strong>By consolidating demand, pooled procurement enhances the collective purchasing power of participating countries. This leverage enables them to negotiate better terms and conditions in supply agreements, potentially lowering the cost of medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Cost Savings:&nbsp;</strong>Economies of scale achieved through pooled procurement can lead to substantial savings. These savings come from reduced unit costs, lower procurement expenses, and decreased overheads in the supply chain and administrative operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Improved Accessibility:</strong>&nbsp;Smaller countries that struggle to meet high minimum order requirements can benefit from pooled procurement. By aggregating their orders with those of other countries, they can access a broader range of medicines, ensuring that no country is left out due to insufficient order volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Quality Assurance:</strong>&nbsp;Consolidation of procurement processes helps maintain high product quality standards. It also fosters local production investment by providing vendors with volume guarantees, encouraging them to invest in local manufacturing facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By leveraging these benefits, the pooled procurement mechanism can play a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency, affordability, and reliability of the pharmaceutical supply chain across Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ensuring Success Of Pooled Procurement in Africa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Implementing pooled procurement in Africa involves several key steps to ensure success and sustainability. Here are the crucial areas of focus:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory and Formulary Harmonization</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To effectively navigate pooled procurement across the continent, a consistent regulatory framework among participating countries is essential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harmonization of standards, guidelines, and procedures for handling and distributing medical products is crucial. This alignment will eliminate bottlenecks in the registration process, pharmacovigilance, and post-market surveillance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 2024, several African countries still lack autonomous national medicines regulatory authorities overseeing the regulation of health products and technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Establishing these authorities and aligning their structures is vital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The African Medicines Agency (AMA) is making progress in this area, aiming to create a unified regulatory environment for pharmaceutical sector development in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 29 out of 55 AU countries having ratified the Treaty, there is optimism that harmonization will pave the way for successful pooled procurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health Policy Alignment</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aligning national formularies, essential medicines lists, and standard treatment guidelines across countries is critical for successful pooled procurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consistent health policies will ensure that the demand for medicines is harmonized, preventing discrepancies in the management of the same diseases across different nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political Goodwill</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achieving pooled procurement requires strong political support. Top leadership and relevant ministries across African countries must collaborate and commit to this strategy. Political goodwill is essential to create the necessary efficiency and reap the intended benefits promptly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign Partnerships</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forming partnerships with regions that have mature pharmaceutical sectors can provide valuable insights and resources. For example, India has demonstrated its capability to consolidate resources and produce medicines for both domestic use and global export.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with such regions can help Africa develop effective pharmaceutical procurement strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional Hubs and Increased Production Capacity</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For pooled procurement of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) targeted for local production, it is more sustainable to establish regional manufacturing hubs rather than individual country-level production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This approach ensures optimal production utilization and increases the capacity of manufacturing plants. Regional hubs can serve specific pharmaceutical market needs, fostering a more efficient and scalable production system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Infrastructural Upgrades</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efficient movement of consignments across countries requires upgraded infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enhancing connectivity through improved transportation networks and upgrading warehousing capabilities to accommodate pharmaceuticals, including those needing specific temperature and humidity controls, is crucial for the success of pooled procurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating Transparency and Visibility</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supply chain optimization requires visibility across the procurement process. Leveraging technology to create a procurement and inventory management platform will enhance transparency within the procurement pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding which countries are ordering which items and in what quantities is essential to prevent overstocking and ensure equitable distribution of medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Implementing pooled procurement in Africa is a multifaceted process that involves regulatory harmonization, health policy alignment, political support, strategic partnerships, regional production hubs, infrastructural upgrades, and enhanced transparency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While not a panacea, pooled procurement, combined with other strategic efforts, holds significant promise for improving Africa&rsquo;s pharmaceutical sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Political will and a collaborative spirit are crucial to overcoming the challenges and realizing the benefits of this initiative, ultimately providing high-quality, safe, and affordable medicines to patients across the continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find this informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://subscribers.africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/public/login\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;now for more.</p>', '1', '7', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Africa.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 12:43:36', '2024-06-19 12:43:36');

(35, 1, 'counterfeit-medicines-3-ways-africa-can-win-the-fight-ii', 0, 'Articles', 0, NULL, NULL, 'Counterfeit Medicines : 3 Ways Africa Can Win The Fight (II)', NULL, NULL, 'Counterfeit Medicines are a pervasive global challenge with Africa showing huge vulnerabilities that make it an easy prey for those involved.', '<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/substandard-and-falsified-medical-products\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;(WHO) defines falsified or counterfeit medicines as those that deliberately or fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are products that have been formulated and developed by entities other than the genuine manufacturers, attempting to mimic the original product without the requisite rights or authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of composition, these medicines may contain no active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), the incorrect API or incorrect amount of API, often substituting this with inert substances like chalk, potato starch or corn starch.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Challenge of Falsified Medicines</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Falsified medicines are a pervasive global challenge, significantly impacting low- and middle-income countries, including those in Africa. It is estimated that 10% of medical products in these regions are either substandard or falsified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite substantial investments in combating counterfeit medical products, this issue persists due to the lucrative nature of the counterfeit medicine market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Falsified medicines are a $200 billion industry, accounting for the largest portion of the $1.7 trillion in fraudulent goods traded globally every year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ramifications of Counterfeit Medicine</strong>s</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passing counterfeit medicines as authentic may have far-reaching implications affecting various stakeholders:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Patients:&nbsp;</strong>The highest concern lies with patients, who may suffer from fatal adverse drug reactions, treatment failures, prolonged hospital stays, antimicrobial resistance, increased healthcare costs, and even death. For instance, it is estimated that 450,000 people die annually from malaria due to falsified antimalarial medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Authentic companies:&nbsp;</strong>Legitimate pharmaceutical companies face undue competition, losing revenue to counterfeit products and suffering brand damage. The fear of counterfeit medicines can deter patients from using genuine products, compelling companies to invest heavily in product authentication measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Healthcare providers and regulatory authorities:</strong>&nbsp;The prevalence of counterfeit medicines can erode trust in healthcare providers and regulatory authorities, questioning their ability to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of medical products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Countries:</strong>&nbsp;Nations dealing with the influx of counterfeit medicines may suffer reputational damage affecting their standing in the global community.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2>Why Africa is Particularly Vulnerable</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Corruption and porous borders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant portion of pharmaceutical products in Africa is imported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And so are counterfeit medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although many African countries have stringent laws and policies for importing medical products, these measures often fail in practice. Corruption and weak border controls allow counterfeit medicines to enter the market unchecked.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>High poverty rates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa has the highest poverty rate globally, with an estimated 35.5% of the population living on less than $1.90 a day. Limited financial resources make it difficult for many to access proper healthcare, leading them to purchase cheaper, unregulated medicines from informal sources. These unverified sources are often counterfeit.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Ineffective National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Approximately, one-third of countries worldwide lack effective drug regulatory authorities, and many African nations fall into this category. Some countries don&rsquo;t have dedicated national drug agencies, while others have regulatory bodies that lack autonomy, adequate financing, infrastructure, and human resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These shortcomings make it challenging to combat counterfeit medicines effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Strategies to fight against counterfeit medicines</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Outsourcing supply chain monitoring systems</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Implementing advanced track-and-trace technology can significantly reduce the prevalence of counterfeit medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the high initial cost deters many manufacturers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outsourcing this function to specialized companies can provide access to the latest technology without the need for substantial capital investment. These companies can develop new-generation taggants, unique identifiers, and encrypted data that can be authenticated by distributors or consumers through scanners and mobile applications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Coordination between regulatory authorities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Strengthening national regulatory authorities is crucial, but collaboration among African countries is equally important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By pooling resources, sharing information, and enhancing post-market surveillance, African nations can present a united front against counterfeit medicines. Cooperative efforts can make it more challenging for counterfeiters to navigate through multiple countries&rsquo; borders and regulatory systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Establishing more WHO-prequalified quality control laboratories can aid in the detection and prevention of counterfeit medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Empower the consumers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Consumers must be educated about the dangers of counterfeit medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anti-counterfeiting strategies often focus on manufacturers, distributors, and regulatory authorities, overlooking the critical role of consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education programs should be designed to help consumers recognize, detect, and report counterfeit medicines. Leveraging platforms like social media and mobile technology (e.g., apps and USSD codes) can facilitate consumer engagement in monitoring and reporting counterfeit products.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Counterfeit medicines remain a huge challenge In Africa and the world at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The continent is extremely vulnerable to these medicines and the nature of the consequences are too devastating to turn a blind eye on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through initiatives such as regulatory harmonization, Africa is well placed to improve on its systemic issues that make it and an easy target for those engaging in the practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And through strategies like empowering consumers, increased coordination between African regulatory authorities and outsourcing supply chain monitoring systems, the continent can make significant strides in combating the scourge of falsified medicines, ensuring safer healthcare outcomes for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Did you find this informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://subscribers.africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/public/login\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>', '1', '11', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Untitled-design-17-1536x864.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-19 12:47:11', '2024-06-19 12:47:11'),

However, in certain instances these microorganisms can develop ways of evading the action of these drugs, despite being administered in the correct doses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the microorganisms remain unresponsive, then we term that phenomenon as antimicrobial resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the consequences of this?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One; you end up with severe illness.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two; if you&rsquo;re admitted in hospital, you will have a longer stay than initially projected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third; If you&rsquo;re lucky and you survive, you will have to part with a lot of money since the commonly used, more affordable antimicrobial agents are no longer working. The doctor will have no choice but to prescribe a more expensive anti-microbial agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth; If you can&rsquo;t afford this newer more effective antibiotic for example, or your infection remains unresponsive, then death can happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did your career journey lead you to antimicrobial resistance?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Smiles) To be honest I haven&rsquo;t really thought about it much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, a lot of my years in service have been dedicated to infectious diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After internship, my first posting was in Malindi District Hospital where I was the first pharmacist in both the hospital and the county (district at the time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the facility level, I was heavily involved in the setting up of the HIV comprehensive care clinic and from that point, I began working very closely in both TB(Tuberculosis) and HIV management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I continued to grow my passion in these diseases over a few years then I transitioned into the Malaria program (while still serving in different capacities).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From that point, I realized I had a passion in infectious diseases and so I applied to do a Master&rsquo;s in Tropical and Infectious Diseases at the University of Nairobi. At the time, this was not one of those career paths that was chosen by pharmacy professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, we were the first cohort of pharmacists to do the course. I remember we were only two female pharmacists in the program and nobody understood why we were there. But the truth is, we were just both passionate about infectious diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I finished training, I ended up at the Jaramogi Odinga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, (formerly the New Nyanza Provincial General Hospital).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be honest,&nbsp;I felt a bit misplaced at the beginning, but eventually I found my space.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that space was in the lab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spent a lot of my time in the lab because I had started to develop a passion in microbiology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Progressively, I studied the patterns of antibiotic use at the hospital trying to correlate this with what was happening at the lab- particularly around culture sensitivity testing. From there I developed an interest in infection prevention and control (IPC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I became part of the team that was strengthening IPC at the hospital as well as conceptualizing what an antimicrobial use program at the hospital would look like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I could complete what we had started, I transitioned into teaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started teaching at the Kenya Medical Training College (KMTC) and that is where I dived into antimicrobial resistance fully. I got an opportunity to coordinate the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Partnership-an initiative that brought together multisectoral experts including animal and plant health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the first situation analysis on antimicrobial use and resistance in Kenya was published, I realized I needed to do something about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started looking for platforms to drive that agenda and I knew that we needed policy support but at the time, the Ministry of Health didn&rsquo;t even have an active antimicrobial resistance program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I started looking for opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest opportunity that presented itself in terms of disseminating the findings, was the Infection Prevention and Control Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spoke at almost every IPC program disseminating the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through that, we developed the IPC strategy and one of the strategic objectives was to establish a national AMR committee from a one health perspective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when that was identified within the IPC strategy, the next natural thing was to have an AMR desk at the Ministry of Health and the rest is history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was appointed as a focal point for AMR, moved from KMTC and went to the Ministry of Health to establish the national AMR program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_5443-1024x575.jpg\" style=\"height:575px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Evelyn Wesangula (R), Senior AMR Control Specialist, ECSA-HC and Dr. Bevin Likuyani (L) , Editor-In-Chief, African Pharmaceutical Review during the interview</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In your current role in the East, Central and Southern Africa Health Community, how does your day to day look like?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My day-to-day revolves around understanding the different contexts of the countries I work in and providing technical support to the implementation of AMR national action plans depending on the individual country&rsquo;s priority level.

Half of that number is expected to be in Africa. &nbsp;This disproportionate burden is driven by weak health systems, poor infrastructure and high levels of poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For us it&rsquo;s a double-edged sword.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the microbes and the inability to treat infections. It&rsquo;s about our capacity to even access and afford general health care and medicines when we need them. &nbsp;How many people are able to pay for culture sensitivity tests?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, patients are unable to pay for basic lab diagnostic tests leading them to self-medication, thinking that it&rsquo;s the cheaper option. But in the long run, it becomes more expensive.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me give you a simple example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a patient today who&rsquo;s admitted in the intensive care unit. And they he has a prescription of a reserve antibiotic like meropenem. This could cost the patient a hundred thousand shillings or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Assuming this is not the only medication he is on, his hospital bill will inevitably skyrocket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I&rsquo;m passionate about AMR because I know what it means for the common person who is unable to afford or access the most effective antibiotic when they need it. &nbsp;In a setting where care is not readily available and the infrastructure is weak, we need to be particularly careful how we handle our reasonably priced antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If people are struggling to access care, then the sustainable development goal on eradication of poverty is unachievable.&nbsp; Access to healthcare for all as well becomes a pipe dream because the truth is; if one can&rsquo;t pay for his or her healthcare, then there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about the SDG on tackling hunger(Goal 2: Zero Hunger) , and I cannot sustain my food production system because there&rsquo;s a lot of use of antibiotics in feed for growth promotion. So, you can see it&rsquo;s a cycle that is not ending. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The environment also we are talking about access to clean water, but if we have industries that are discharging effluent into our water bodies, what are we saying in terms of achieving our SDGs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For us in sub&ndash;Saharan Africa, our levels of income are low, so we are unable to meet some of our very basic needs. Therefore, we need to make sure as much as possible, we are using our antimicrobial agents in an optimal way so we are not caught flat-footed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What activities are happening continentally to improve AMR surveillance and strengthen stewardship?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honestly, I must thank all the implementing partners that have come in to support AMR efforts in different ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before countries started working on their national action plans, the World Bank came in to support laboratory infrastructure across several countries in the Eastern and Southern Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, as countries took on the global action plan and began to develop their own national action plans, at the AU (African Union) level we established a common position by Heads of States in Africa on antimicrobial resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The African Union through the Africa CDC has been able to support quite a lot of initiatives in building capacity for antimicrobial resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the laboratory network through partnerships with the Africa Society for Laboratory Medicine, the East Central and Southern Africa Health Community, West African Health Organization (WAHO), and SADEC (Southern African Development Community) in the South. All this working together and mobilizing resources to build capacity at various levels-through training or development and harmonization of guidance documents</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Fleming Fund has been one of our largest investors in AMR surveillance, helping for example in building capacity for laboratories, purchasing equipment, reagents and also building capacity in many countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries including Tanzania, Uganda., Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, Malawi and many more have all benefited from the Fleming Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also projects supported by the USAID.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>React Africa have also been champion advocates from a civil society perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We still have big gaps in terms of what needs to be done but we are on the right path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Governments have been slow in terms of allocating budgets to support antimicrobial resistance. That has slowed the initiatives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when they will come in and augment what partners are doing the countries will be able to do much more. We are definitely not where we were five years ago but there&rsquo;s still so much to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research and building a case for investment around antimicrobial resistance is still an area more effort needs to be put.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What does One Health mean to you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Health means different sectors coming together and working from a shared vision to achieve a common goal. &nbsp;In our context, it involves bringing together human, animal and plant health, as well as the environment, moving in the same direction towards prevention and containment of antimicrobial resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal is to ensure that all sectors play a key role in prevention and mitigation of the effects of antimicrobial resistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One Health approach is critical because four sectors can do much more than one sector can ever do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of resource mobilization, reach, scope of activities a lot can be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean even at the global level, we no longer talk about the Tripartite, now it&rsquo;s Quadripartite.&nbsp; Food and Agriculture Organization, the World Health Organization, the Animal Organization, the World Organization for Animal Health, and the United Nations Environmental Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe we need to start building this concept of One Health right from school, including it in the curricula as well as in continuous medical education, for those already graduated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What role do community pharmacies play in antimicrobial resistance?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I see community pharmacies as gatekeepers and therefore critical players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re the first point of contact with the community-hence gatekeeper because they hold the decision as to whether to let someone in or not.&nbsp; When a patient comes to their premises, they have the power to either support the optimal use of antimicrobial or encourage misuse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Community pharmacy personnel have the knowledge on antimicrobial agents and resistance. They understand for example what happens when a patient walks away with half a dose of amoxicillin administering one stat dose of ceftriaxone or even dispensing an antibiotic for a viral infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As gatekeepers, community pharmacies have the authority required to control how the community consumes medication. It&rsquo;s just about prioritizing the patient&rsquo;s health over profits because as I mentioned to you, resistance doesn&rsquo;t discriminate who it affects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that is why, when we developed the regional guidelines on antimicrobial stewardship for the countries in East and South Africa, we went beyond just the hospital. Because we know pharmacies play a critical role in public health in the continent as the first stop in seeking healthcare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even at the National level (in Kenya), the antimicrobial stewardship guidelines are not limited to the hospital. There&rsquo;s a component for community pharmacies. So, it&rsquo;s important for these key stakeholders</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is it so easy to access antibiotics over the counter in a country like Kenya, yet this is unacceptable in for example European countries? Is it a policy issue?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Smiles) That&rsquo;s a very interesting question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s definitely not a policy issue, its simply lack of enforcement of already available regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antibiotics should not be sold over the counter under any circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are two ways to correct this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One: the regulator should enforce what the policy says. &ldquo;Prescription Only Medicines&rdquo; should be prescription only medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two: Self-regulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should make an effort to self-regulate, especially at the community pharmacy level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We shouldn&rsquo;t wait for the regulator to come and impose policies on us. We should take initiative and do what&rsquo;s right, prioritizing client&rsquo;s health over the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What message do you have for health workers about antimicrobial resistance?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a health worker, you are the authority when it comes to matters health.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key questions that has come back to us many times is what if the patients prefer this antibiotic? What if the patient has asked for the antibiotic?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me ask you as the health worker, who&rsquo;s the authority? Who knows what&rsquo;s best for the patient?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the first thing I want to emphasize is education and advocacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take time to educate your patients when they come to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re the nurse, you&rsquo;re administering medicine, be consistent and administer according to the prescription.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re the doctor who&rsquo;s prescribing, are you taking time to speak to your patients regarding their illness, the drug you prescribe, and why it&rsquo;s important for them to adhere to the dose that you&rsquo;ve given them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the pharmacist, you need to understand that a lot of information will come from you. You&rsquo;re the person who Interacts with the patient at the end of that chain. When all has been said and done, in that healthcare system, the last person who hands over this medicine to the patient is the pharmacist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take time. When we did rational use medicine surveying, sometimes patient encounters at pharmacies are at times one minute or less.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patient encounters with the doctor-five minutes.&nbsp; How much information can you pass on as a pharmacist, within a minute?&nbsp; How much information can you pass on as a doctor within five minutes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone needs to understand their role and play their part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, I believe compliance to Infection Prevention and Control is a cheap intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be done by everyone. Every infection prevented is an antimicrobial agent spared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And one of the simple infection prevention and control interventions I would recommend and emphasize on is hand hygiene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hand hygiene has been neglected in many of our healthcare settings.&nbsp; And we see adherence rates as low as 10 percent in healthcare settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up to 80 percent of all healthcare associated infections can be limited if hand hygiene is adhered to.&nbsp; So if we comply to that, then we are able to reduce the transmission of multidrug resistant organisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hospital acquired infections account for high consumption of reserve antibiotics. They are very expensive to treat and very difficult to manage. And I say this because our 2023 report on the top five microorganisms isolated in this setting are all associated with health care associated infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Klebsiella pneumoniae; Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,&nbsp; E.coli, and Staphylococcus aureus These are very difficult to manage, especially in the healthcare&nbsp; setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On rational use of antimicrobial agents;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes as healthcare workers, we are the worst patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are the ones who actually drive AMR, in our own setting. So, let&rsquo;s be custodians for these drugs. And I think when we do that, then it will be better for everyone else. Of course, keep spreading the word.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you&rsquo;re able to carry out operational research in your healthcare setting, use this data to inform decisions that are being made in your respective settings, each of us has a role to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s also use community health workers for advocacy initiatives in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And the public?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, don&rsquo;t self-medicate.&nbsp; Please take the opinion of your healthcare provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When unwell, visit the hospital and allow the doctor to do the prescribing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t make Dr. Google your best friend because I promise you, you will treat things that are not there. &nbsp;If you persist with self-medication, you will jeopardize your future since when you will eventually need these antibiotics, they may turn out to be ineffective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, avoid over the counter purchase of antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, please don&rsquo;t give pressure to your healthcare provider.&nbsp; These qualified professionals know the treatment protocols and are able to provide the best treatment options for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly, practice hygiene and vaccination for both yourself and the animals you may be keeping. This is key in infection prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start with basic practices such as hand-washing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s accept that we have a problem. Let&rsquo;s accept that we have been part of the problem and we definitely hold the solution</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Did you find this video informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@AfricanPharmaceuticalReview\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>', '1', '7', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/IMG_5443-1536x863.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-20 10:35:20', '2024-06-20 10:35:20');

Whether it&rsquo;s overuse or underuse, it boils down to inappropriate use of antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be clear AMR involves all classes of antimicrobial agents however for the sake of this conversation I&rsquo;ll focus on antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-6-1-1024x684.jpg\" style=\"height:684px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is it something we should care about?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Sir Alexander Fleming was accepting his Nobel Prize for his 1928 discovery of penicillin, he did caution that using penicillin in the wrong way would eventually lead to a point where this drug would no longer work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bit of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the emergence of penicillin, people were dying from the most basic infections; minor wounds, pneumonia, they were all death sentences. &nbsp;So, when it came along, penicillin was a lifesaver as it spared thousands of soldiers from deaths from gunshot wounds and other injuries acquired from the trenches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward a couple of years later;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antibiotics were all of a sudden, a gold mine that was attracting a lot of investments and therefore manufactured left, right and center. Unfortunately, with this, the issue of misuse became a reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a short period of time microbes started showing signs of resistance against these &lsquo;new antibiotics.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sir Fleming&rsquo;s prediction came true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the recent past discovery of new antibiotics has been far and between. At some point there was a 30-year gap where we didn&rsquo;t see any antibiotic coming through. And even when new ones emerged, they were merely combinations of already existing molecular formulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What has happened is that we are now at an era where we&rsquo;re seeing a dry pipeline of antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies have shied away from investing in products that they believe in a few years may become ineffective, triggering a dip in sales. At the end of the day, all businesses focus on the bottom line; a solid return on investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, we are facing a glooming reality that we might not have antibiotics moving forward. Essentially, a post-antibiotic era. Similar to the period before the Second World War, that was a pre-antibiotic era. If status quo remains as far as addressing antimicrobial resistance is concerned, then we will move to a post-antibiotic era where we will struggle to find effective treatment for common infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What will that mean?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its simplest form, a paper cut may drive you six feet under.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A young mother giving birth through cesarean section in a low resourced setting where there&rsquo;s poor infection prevention control and lack of prophylactic medication for infection prevention, will face the cruel possibility of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consequences don&rsquo;t just end there unfortunately; In Africa, non-communicable diseases (including cancer) have progressively emerged as a huge source of disease burden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To treat cancer, antibiotics are needed because the patients&rsquo; immunity tend to become compromised. Making them vulnerable to opportunistic infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So as much as the anti-cancer medication may be effective, patients may still lose their lives due to lack of effective treatment options to manage the hospital or community acquired infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And there are many other scenarios similar to this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impact of AMR cuts across individuals, sectors and even regions. So, we all have to come together and do something about it. We all have a role to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How was your journey like leading you to the antimicrobial resistance space?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Smiles) You know, I&rsquo;ve been asked that question so many times, so I&rsquo;ve had time to reflect on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although I didn&rsquo;t realize it at the time, my passion for public health started right from when I was a pharmacist intern in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At that early part of my career, I quickly realized that our public health care system needed a lot of improvement. Similar to most African countries. Seeing patients who were unable to afford a prescription costing less than a dollar is an example of the scenarios that I witnessed and felt that something needed to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward a few years later and I join the private sector- which was a whole other world altogether.&nbsp; Patients were able to pay for six-month worth of antiretroviral prescriptions sometimes costing almost a thousand dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A stark difference from what I had seen in public sector and honestly that just didn&rsquo;t sit right with me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I took up a course; Master&rsquo;s in Public Health and once I graduated, I thought to myself, I think I&rsquo;m done with the clinical/administration space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I volunteered at an NGO, the Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network (EPN) so that I could put in practice what I had learnt. In that sense develop the public health skills which I knew were vital for me to have any sort of impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, they needed someone who had experience in HIV programmes, which I had. Volunteered for about six months trying to strengthen the HIV program. So, that&rsquo;s how I got into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thereafter, NGO world being what it is; where you can shift from one programme to another, I ended up in the AMR space.&nbsp; While in this new space I realized; this is something I&rsquo;ve been dealing with since I started my career.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even back then, in hospital practice when I was the chief pharmacist at the Mombasa Hospital, I had overseen the development of the hospital&rsquo;s antibiotic treatment guidelines and policy to reshape how antimicrobial agents were used at the hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How were they used?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like many hospitals, the consultant doctors would from the onset go for the &lsquo;big guns&rsquo;-the reserve antibiotics-like meropenem. When there was no clear justification that this was necessary. &nbsp;At the time, I would just comply and issue these drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thinking about it now, I was contributing to AMR in a negative way(sighs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, it&rsquo;s the same in many other hospitals where pharmacists get intimidated and fail to speak against inappropriate use of antibiotics. Especially when the culture is propagated by senior doctors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s therefore a goal of mine to ensure that young pharmacists are not pushed around, like I was back then, to create this monster called antimicrobial resistance. A monster that is claiming the lives of patients and our colleagues alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/dr-christabel-khaemba-patient-safety-in-africa-through-pharmacovigilance/\">Dr. Christabel Khaemba : Patient Safety In Africa Through Pharmacovigilance (africanpharmaceuticalreview.com)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>What does your day-day job look like as a senior policy officer at ReAct Africa?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, on a normal day, to be honest, it depends on what hat I&rsquo;m wearing. I could be directly involved in an on the ground project or in the back-end in a policy driven initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in Kenya I lead some antimicrobial stewardship programs. Currently we&rsquo;re heavily involved in Makueni County where we work with a very supportive leadership to promote rational use of antimicrobial agents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I try getting into the trenches involving myself with the stewardship projects, interventions and activities that help reduce misuse of these medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This entails going to the facilities, of course in collaboration with the county AMR, and Infection Prevention Control (IPC) focal persons. Carrying out baseline surveys to see how the facilities are equipped to handle infections and how they use the antibiotics. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thereafter we forge a way forward and hit the ground running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacity building is also a close feature in the scope of work I do. It&rsquo;s important for us to ensure that the hospital teams we work with are able to sustain the efforts we have started together. The truth of the matter is that myself as Tracie representing ReAct Africa whether it&rsquo;s technical or financial support we will exit at some point and focus on a different project elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t mean that just because we have pulled out, then everything has to go back to where it was. That&rsquo;s why capacity building and empowerment is really at the core of the work we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim is to catalyze action on AMR globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without creating awareness and building capacity around the different facets that directly and indirectly affect AMR then it won&rsquo;t be fruitful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without proper capacity, you&rsquo;re leaving a huge lacuna when you exit and the project gains will fail in the long-run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to policy, my work centers around advocacy; lobbying, networking and creating those relationships that are paramount to success through the One Health approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I must say I am quite passionate in advocacy. Whether it&rsquo;s to the policy makers, healthcare workers, administration, consumer groups, all of it, I enjoy it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing I&rsquo;d say is to advocate efficiently, you have to always keep yourself informed on the different events happening across the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no short cut: you have to be well-versed with the current affairs and developments happening around you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, the Ukraine war resulted in food insecurity in our region, which in turn negatively impacts on immunity and health, which could then lead to increased infections and consequent use of antimicrobials and hence AMR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Policy influence is quite dynamic; so, if you snooze, you lose (laughs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"antimicrobial resistance\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-7-1024x684.jpg\" style=\"height:684px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you think antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, should be used in agriculture?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be an outright lie to say that we should not use antibiotics within the animal and fisheries sector.&nbsp; You might as well then say humans shouldn&rsquo;t also use antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, there are guidelines in place that inform when and how these antimicrobials should be used in these sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of these medicines in animals is guided by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Codex Alimentarius</a>. If the animal is unwell for example, a qualified veterinarian who has made a diagnosis can go ahead and prescribe antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem comes in when we misuse.&nbsp; For example, the inappropriate use of antibiotics as growth promoters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This practice has become quite rampant mainly due to misinformation and weak regulatory enforcement. For example, I know there are pharmacies that dispense&nbsp;<strong>colistin</strong>&ndash; a reserve antibiotic, to farmers to help hasten growth of poultry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what happens is that people end up consuming chicken or eggs containing antimicrobial residues. Microbes in their bodies end up being exposed to sub-optimal levels of colistin encouraging resistance. When they are admitted in the ICU needing the same antibiotic, there is a high chance it won&rsquo;t work leading to preventable death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to advocate for appropriate use of antimicrobial agents both in humans and animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the positive side, there are institutions like Kenchick (a poultry company in Kenya) that are doing their part. In fact, it was recently recognized by the International Poultry Council as the only company in Africa that operates within clear antimicrobial stewardship principles as outlined by the Poultry Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are there any myths related to use of antimicrobial agents that you would like to burst?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One: We always need antibiotics when we are unwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccination is a core element in preserving public health and for most regions the uptake has been promising. I say this because vaccines fundamentally ensure that we are not severely affected by disease when we do get an infection. Both in humans and animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it does not necessarily mean that immediately we get an infection, that directly translates to a shot of an antibiotic. In certain instances, your strengthened immunity may be good enough to clear the microbe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two: A scratchy throat equals a dose of antibiotics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>âMajority of upper respiratory infections including cold and flu are viral. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin don&rsquo;t have a role to play in these scenarios. Viral infections should be let to run their course while managing symptoms or use antiviral agents when applicable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sidenote: I remember a lot of people discovered azithromycin during the covid pandemic and they preferred it mainly due to the once-a-day 3-day dose duration. This opened a can of worms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three: antimicrobial injections are stronger and are preferred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you&rsquo;ve been diagnosed with a bacterial infection, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that an injectable antibiotic is the only thing that will work.&nbsp; If the patient doesn&rsquo;t have a severe infection, is able to eat, swallow and retain food and water, why should they be put on injectable antibiotics?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interesting thing is that sometimes when we assess patient files, we find a patient who is on oral paracetamol tablets and amoxiclav injection. Why?&nbsp; I mean they should both be oral dosage forms, no?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Untitled-design-8-1024x684.jpg\" style=\"height:684px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There is a difference between how antibiotics are dispensed in European countries compared to Africa. In those countries you need a prescription but locally you access these medicines over the counter. What&rsquo;s happening there, is it a policy problem or an implementation problem?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Implementation for sure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ll give you the example of Kenya; people come to benchmark not only just on medicine use but also many other policies. I mean, we&rsquo;ve got the brains, the skill and the know-how to produce beautiful policies. And then what happens after, we put them in our shelves and we forget about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Really, it&rsquo;s the implementation, enactment and enforcement of the relevant laws that is missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As pharmacy professionals we should remain firm when implementing guidelines on rational use of medicines. No-one should ever pressure you to dispense or issue an antimicrobial agent that is inappropriate for the patient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We should also have integrity when dispensing these medicines. I understand sometimes we could be in the middle of harsh economic times but that doesn&rsquo;t mean all of a sudden doing the right thing goes out of the window. Self-policing is key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it can be done, I mean look at our neighbors, Rwanda and Ethiopia, you can&rsquo;t just walk into a pharmacy and buy antibiotics without a valid prescription.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are there continental efforts in the fight against AMR?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Africa Union through Africa CDC, and in collaboration with the regional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/one-health/background/coordination/en#:~:text=Quadripartite%20-%20who%20we%20are&amp;text=The%20Quadripartite%20agencies%20develop%20and,resistance%20and%20emerging%20zoonotic%20diseases.\" target=\"_blank\">Quadripartite</a>&nbsp;: The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)) have done considerable work in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, in 2017, Africa CDC developed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/Users/alexm/Downloads/Africa-CDC-AMR-Framework-EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Africa CDC Framework for Antimicrobial Resistance Control in Africa</a>&nbsp;&ndash; later endorsed by the Africa Union Assembly as the Africa Union Framework for Antimicrobial Resistance Control in Africa (2018 &ndash; 2023).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their strategy revolves around four areas &ndash; improve surveillance of AMR organisms and antimicrobial use, delay emergence of resistant infections, limit infection transmission and mitigate harm among patients infected with AMR organisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa CDC, through its AMR task force has also overseen the development of other guiding documents for the region, such as The African Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines for Common Bacterial Infections and Syndromes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What these guidelines do is to guide healthcare providers with best practices on antimicrobial selection, dosage and duration of treatment for infections. It covers both adult and pediatric patients. Also, the Framework for One Health Practice in National Public Health Institutes, to address prevention and control of zoonotic diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa CDC is also working closely with Regional Coordinating Centers and economic blocs to address antimicrobial resistance. So, there&rsquo;s a good blueprint, a framework of the way things are supposed to work through the Africa Union-Africa CDC within our region in collaboration with the Quadripartite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa CDC works as well with the Quadripartite regionally to ensure that governance and coordination is taking on a regional approach and then trickle down to the different countries. So, a lot is happening. It&rsquo;s just that now countries (member states) also have to walk the talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So, being World AMR Awareness Week, what message would you want to put out?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all have a role to play when it comes to antimicrobial resistance. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just about understanding what that role is and being consistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What this means is that we don&rsquo;t limit our AMR advocacy messages to just the WAAW week (18th-24th&nbsp;November) where it&rsquo;s all blue everywhere with all the right messages, then after that what happens? Silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message relayed must be on a continuous basis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you take nothing else home, just realize that AMR knows no borders. Think back to the COVID pandemic that affected all regions of the world. AMR is no different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People call it the silent pandemic but I don&rsquo;t agree with this. Because it&rsquo;s there, faceless yes, but it&rsquo;s there and the effects are devastating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, a country performing well should have a drug resistance index (a qualifier for a country&rsquo;s status on AMR) of less than 25%. Unfortunately, in Africa according to a study done in 2019-2020, no country in the study recorded a DRI below 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meaning, there&rsquo;s a high chance that the antimicrobial medicines in our continent are already not effective or are losing their ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, AMR knows no boundaries, color, race or status.&nbsp; If a resistant bug knocks on your door, then you better pray. Pray that the necessary ammunition is available to fight it. &nbsp;And if it is available, do pray that you have the finances and resources to access it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, let&rsquo;s act now and &ldquo;prevent antimicrobial resistance together.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>Did you find this article informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more.</p>', '1', '11', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Blue-Modern-Tips-Business-Banner-10-1536x768.jpg', NULL, 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/audio/Dr.-Tracie-excerpt.mp3', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-20 03:44:59', '2024-06-20 03:44:59'),

A member of the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization Technical Committee on Regulatory Capacity Development in Africa and currently, a PhD student at the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with her colleagues in Kenya and within the continent, they have put in concerted efforts in ensuring the continent moves as one in upscaling the African pharmaceutical industry through harmonized, strong and robust regulatory systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we mark the World&rsquo;s Patient Day, Dr. Christabel helps us decipher how we can leverage on pharmacovigilance to enhance patient safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did your pharmacy career lead you to pharmacovigilance?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After graduation, I did my hospital internship at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and was later posted to work as a hospital pharmacist at the now Nyamira County Referral Hospital (formerly a District Hospital).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At KNH, participating in ward rounds and managing medicines at the Comprehensive Care Clinic were a major part of the internship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in the case of Nyamira, I had to make a conscious effort to take part in hospital ward rounds with focus on reviewing patient treatments as well as offering guidance on the treatment options we had at the pharmacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Smiles] The funny thing is that at the time, my other colleagues did not understand why the pharmacist in charge kept attending ward rounds instead of staying at the pharmacy to oversee the operations of the pharmacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I guess this bewilderment was born from the fact that clinical pharmacy practice in hospitals was a relatively new concept and had not been appreciated as an important contributor to good therapeutic outcomes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, I was managing the antiretroviral medication at the HIV clinic where the Government had just rolled out the free HAART therapy and as a pharmacist, one of the key roles I played in the program was monitoring compliance and adherence to the medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In that regard, I noticed that patients would discontinue treatment either due to side effects which they labelled &lsquo;unbearable&rsquo;. Some would give feedback that they experienced different effects with different brands of medicines despite having the same active ingredients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, these incidents would be documented in the patient files but there was nowhere to report them, I remember we would call NASCOP to get guidance on how to manage the reported adverse events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) launched the National Pharmacovigilance System, I was lucky to be part of the team that was sensitized in Nyanza on the concepts of Pharmacovigilance and its potential impact in ensuring patient safety.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, I was intrigued by the conversations and I remember thinking to myself; &ldquo;this is something I would like to pivot towards in my career.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&nbsp;</strong>mentioned a<strong>bout a personal experience?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I remember vividly a time when my dad was unwell.&nbsp; So of course, he went to the hospital and was prescribed for medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You see, when the medicine was dispensed, it was labelled 2&times;3 ostensibly meaning two tablets to be taken three times a day. But due to maybe old age or improper patient counselling during dispensing, he ended up multiplying that and taking 6 tablets one morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, the effects that ensued were not as severe as they could have potentially been.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He developed xerostomia (dry mouth) and this was enough to convince him that there was a conspiracy against his life and swore not to continue taking the medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later we laughed about it that being a former teacher he decided to be smart and proceeded to carry out some mathematical calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This literally hit close to home and only served to strengthen my resolve in pursuing a career leaning more towards patient safety through pharmacovigilance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward a few years later, I get a posting from the Ministry to PPB and was deployed at the PV/PMS unit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>According to the World Health Organization, as many as one in ten medical products circulating in developing countries are substandard or falsified. Of all the falsified drugs reported to the WHO between 2013 and 2017, 42% of the reports came from the African region.&nbsp;Why is Africa this vulnerable?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa faces multiple economic, social, and political challenges in comparison to more developed continents such as Europe, North America, and parts of Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These challenges include income inequality, infrastructure limitations, restricted access to essential services like healthcare, and political instability, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collectively, these factors create a conducive environment for the infiltration of substandard or counterfeit medical products into the supply chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weak border controls, coupled with porous borders, have significantly facilitated the smuggling and illicit trade of medical products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The upsurge in internet-based commerce also opens up multiple avenues for counterfeiters to directly engage with consumers, thus evading regulatory oversight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additional factors, such as limited access to affordable medical products and the high cost of certain prescription medications, may force consumers to seek more &ldquo;cost-effective alternatives&rdquo; typically outside the established, regulated distribution channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lack of public awareness across the African population regarding the consequences and risks associated with substandard and counterfeit products is also a huge facilitating factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Africa, in general, struggles with a high burden of infectious diseases, including acute respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhoea, malaria, and tuberculosis. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You realize Access to these treatments has continued to grow in Africa, however, we need to appreciate that these efforts are not always matched with the capabilities of some of the National Medicines Regulatory Authorities to Monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of these products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would say in general; most regulatory authorities in Africa are still evolving in their quest to achieve level 3 or 4 WHO regulatory systems&rsquo; maturity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level 3 represents stable, well-functioning and integrated regulatory systems while Level 4 represents regulatory systems operating at an advanced level of performance and continuous improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are some of the negative effects of and challenges faced in the monitoring and management of poor-quality medicines, adverse reactions and medication errors?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever a patient experiences any of these issues, the result generally is prolonged sickness, treatment failure, antimicrobial resistance, non-compliance (due to adverse events), increased treatment costs, and in unfortunate circumstances death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patients tend to lose confidence in healthcare systems when these eventualities occur, not well managed and not sensitized about them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of challenges, the major ones faced include absence of medication safety monitoring programs in hospitals, unbridged staffing needs, poor communication links between the patients and the healthcare professionals., underreporting of medication errors and ADRs due to fear of victimization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Genetic differences in patients also make it hard to identify and manage ADRs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/topics/news/gambia-70-children-lost-lives-due-to-substandard-cough-syrups\">Gambia: 70 children lost lives due to substandard cough syrups (africanpharmaceuticalreview.com)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>In Africa there are countries to this date don&rsquo;t have a Pharmacovigilance department in their national drug regulatory agencies. The Gambia for example has only recently initiated the process of establishing one after the death of 70 children due to substandard cough syrups. Why is it such a challenge to set up and implement PV systems in the continent?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The confirmation that 70 children in Gambia lost their lives directly due to the consumption of certain cough syrups is undeniably a tragic and deeply unfortunate event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This heartbreaking incident serves as a reminder of the critical importance of pharmacovigilance in ensuring the safety of medical products and highlighted the urgent need for systems to monitor and prevent such occurrences both in the continent and globally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The disaster in The Gambia greatly mirrors past events that birthed PV systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, safety monitoring was not something that was given much prominence and it is worth noting that the presence of diethylene glycol in sulfonamide elixir in the USA in 1938 and the Thalidomide tragedy in Germany in the early 60s prompted the setting up of safety surveillance systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many regulatory authorities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) face resource constraints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Establishing effective pharmacovigilance systems demands adequate resources and personnel, which can be particularly challenging to attain in such settings, this I believe contributed largely to the incident in the Gambia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of adequate regulatory frameworks in Africa also hampers the setting up and implementation of robust PV systems in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ppb2-1024x778.png\" style=\"height:778px; width:1024px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pharmacy and Poisons Board, The National Medicines Regulatory Agency in Kenya (credit PPB)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How has the Pharmacy and Poisons Board overcome these challenges?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to say there was both goodwill and passion from both the management at PPB and my predecessors in the setting up of the national pharmacovigilance system in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has made it easier for the current team to make the system resilient and in line with the growing global trends. The Institutionalization of Pharmacovigilance and systemic capacity-building approach have gone a long way in the growth of pharmacovigilance in Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key factors that have worked for PV in Kenya include having a clear regulatory framework on pharmacovigilance and post-market surveillance; the pharmacovigilance and post-market surveillance rules enable the PPB to implement PV activities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through these Rules, County Governments now are able to designate County Vigilance focal persons to coordinate the implementation of pharmacovigilance and post-market surveillance activities within the counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This I believe is a major step forward because these focal persons are in direct involvement with what is ongoing in the county and therefore communication is enhanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market Authorization Holders are also now required to appoint Qualified Persons for Pharmacovigilance who are responsible in monitoring the products on the Kenyan Market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaborations with different stakeholders has also been instrumental in the implementation of PV activities. These include academia, public health programs, counties and development partners especially when it comes to leveraging on the limited available resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional collaborations within economic blocs such as The East African Community and The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD have been instrumental in our progressive successes as well through the harmonization processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capacity building of health care professions at both in- and pre-service levels has played a key role in cascading PV activities within the health facilities which in turn has an impact on patient safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A major criticism that has been directed to the Pharmacy and Poisons Board (the national drug regulatory agency in Kenya) is the lack of feedback when PV reports are submitted. Why is that?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Smiles) I don&rsquo;t necessarily look at it as criticism but more of feedback. And to me any feedback is good feedback because it helps us improve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although sometimes it may not be the feedback we want to hear as the people implementing these activities (laughs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different pharmacovigilance centers adopt varying approaches when it comes to the receiving, processing, and management of individual case safety reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These differences can be influenced by the complexity of their systems and the availability of personnel and resources. Although, there is a general framework that guides the handling of these reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The standard process involves the initial receipt of an individual case safety report, followed by diligent efforts to gather additional or missing information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, the report is validated, taking into account criteria for seriousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confirmed serious cases undergo further investigation, and causality is assessed by expert committees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feedback arising from the causality assessment is then issued. It&rsquo;s important to note that feedback on reported adverse events can occur at any stage of this process, and the timelines involved may vary depending on internal procedures and the complexity of the reported event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it cannot be overstated that providing timely feedback to both reporters and the general public, especially for adverse events of public concern, plays a crucial role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;It not only encourages continued reporting but also helps rebuild trust and ensures patient safety</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At PPB we are continuously improving our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pv.pharmacyboardkenya.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Pharmacovigilance Electronic Reporting System (PvERS)&nbsp;</a>to make it as interactive as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the system you are now able to have a snap shot of what is being reported across the county.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quarterly reports that give a summary of what reports were received and trends are also published on the PPB website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe this counts as feedback, right? (smiles)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, feedback can be given inform of a joint communication to different stakeholders, for instance release of a safety alert to the public as a result of a report you submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are there any global or continental efforts to enhance patient safety through pharmacovigilance?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes indeed, there are ongoing global and continental efforts to enhance patient safety concerning medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globally, the World Health Organization leads a program for international drug monitoring that boasts over 155 full and 21 associate member states. These member states actively contribute individual case safety reports to a global repository known as&nbsp;<strong>Vigibase</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collaborative effort allows for the identification of potential medicinal safety concerns on a global scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WHO has also put in place pharmacovigilance indicators, which basically help countries to be able to assess where they are in terms of the implementation of pharmacovigilance activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through global benchmarking, WHO is working with regulatory Authorities to ensure the Pharmacovigilance Systems are fully functional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, regional pharmacovigilance harmonization initiatives have been actively pursued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD) has launched the Smart Safety Surveillance Program, designed to bolster safety surveillance for priority medical products throughout the African continent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, AUDA-NEPAD, through the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization (AMRH) program, established Regional Centers of Regulatory Excellence (RCOREs) across various fields, including Pharmacovigilance, to enhance regulatory capacity development in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These efforts ultimately improve patient safety in multiple ways.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an example, Kenya&rsquo;s national pharmacovigilance centre, which is located at the Pharmacy and Poisons Board and the Ghana FDA, serve as RCOREs in Pharmacovigilance for the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These initiatives collectively represent significant strides toward ensuring the safety of medicines, not only at a continental level but also within specific regions, ultimately benefiting patient well-being and public health.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the onset of the African Medicines Agency, it is envisaged that AfriVigilance a continental database including data on the end-to-end safety lifecycle of priority medical products in Africa will be set up to enable the ownership and analysis of African data in the African context to inform key safety decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The AfriVigilance will be complementary to the Uppsala Monitoring Centre where data will be linked and shared with the VigiBase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would also want to mention that through the European Development for Clinical Trials &nbsp;Partnership (EDCTP), currently, there are two &nbsp;consortiums running &nbsp;within the continent that have been Key in supporting PV and PMS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacovigilance infrastructure and post-marketing surveillance system capacity building for regional medicine regulatory harmonization in East Africa (PROFORMA) a joint venture between experts from academia, NMRAs and WHO-collaborating centres in pharmacovigilance and RCOREs to generate a cohort of pharmacovigilance trained human resources from all stockholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These include patients, healthcare providers, regulatory staffs that are engaged in pharmacovigilance data collection, analysis, interpretation and data sharing in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also have the PhArmacoVIgilance Africa (PAVIA) consortium that aims to strengthen pharmacovigilance (PV) in four African countries: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Eswatini, and Tanzania.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What role can technology play in pharmacovigilance and patient safety?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technology is vital. I&rsquo;ll use PPB&rsquo;s evolution to explain this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pharmacovigilance Electronic Reporting System at the Pharmacy and Poisons Board has significantly enhanced the ease of reporting adverse events for healthcare professionals, marketing authorization holders, and the general public to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This system, available in both electronic and mobile application versions (mPvERS on both Android and iOS operating systems), as well as through USSD code (*271#), has streamlined the process of submitting a wide range of adverse event reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From adverse drug reactions, medication errors, suspected poor-quality products, medical device incidents, to blood transfusion reactions PV reporting has been made easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The adoption of this electronic system has notably improved the completeness and quality of individual case safety reports submitted to the National Pharmacovigilance Centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, it has facilitated the timely sharing of identified adverse event reports with the global database, VigiBase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most valuable aspects of the electronic system is its efficiency. It saves time by enabling reports to reach the National Pharmacovigilance Centre instantly for further processing and management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, it allows for real-time interactions with reporters, further enhancing the overall effectiveness of the pharmacovigilance reporting process.&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The timely processing of the reports has a great impact on patient safety by allowing prompt mitigation actions to be taken, providing feedback and also supporting PV activities such as causality assessment of serious cases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you have to be a pharmacist or pharmacy professional to ensure patient safety in medicine use? Do patients have a role to play?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So interestingly, when it comes to patient safety, I&rsquo;ll say it&rsquo;s a collaborative responsibility and everybody including patients themselves, healthcare professional, pharma manufacturers, the government and the policy makers should be involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everybody has a role to play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, traditionally the mention of &lsquo;pharma&rsquo;, tends to make people think it&rsquo;s a pharmacist only initiative. That is far from the reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that&rsquo;s why we are moving towards the term &lsquo;vigilance&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;pharmacovigilance&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The public, in particular, has several essential roles to fulfill in this endeavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like adhering to instructions and guidance provided by healthcare professionals, promptly reporting adverse events and suspected poor-quality medicines, and actively participating in awareness programs aimed at promoting safe and effective healthcare practices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are your plans for World Patient Safety Day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year there is an exciting collaboration happening on Friday, 15th&nbsp;September 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pharmacy and Poisons Board, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the Kenya Association of Pharmaceutical Industries, and patient advocacy groups, has organized a special awareness event &ndash; a walk aimed at educating the general public on the importance of patient safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This walk will start at Afya House and culminate at the Arboretum, where a series of engaging activities and initiatives will take place, all geared towards advancing the cause of patient safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I strongly encourage all healthcare professionals and members of the general public to join in this collective effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, I urge everyone to consider taking personal actions and measures that contribute to patient safety in their daily lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, we can make a significant impact on patient safety and improve healthcare outcomes for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Any parting shot?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I just want to appreciate how far pharmacovigilance in the continent has come.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the teething problems that we had; I&rsquo;ll say Kenya has made quite some strides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have now integrated pharmacovigilance into public health programs and formed cross-working technical groups to enhance the agenda of pharmacovigilance and post-market surveillance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automating the data-collecting process through our PvERS and acting as a benchmark for other African countries is something we are proud of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A patient reporting platform, to me that&rsquo;s also a big success in our quest to enhance patient safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I understand the responsibility on the hands of the pharmacists when it comes to pharmacovigilance hands but I also reiterate that patient safety is a collaborative effort for all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not just about the pharmacist or the regulator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of us have a role to play in it, starting from the patient, the healthcare professionals, the Pharma industry, the policymakers, the media basically the country at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pharmacovigilance ensures patient safety; patient safety ensures a healthy nation and a healthy nation ensures a working nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find this interview informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a>&nbsp;for more!</p>', '1', '11', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Blue-Modern-Tips-Business-Banner-8-1536x768.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-20 03:52:39', '2024-06-20 03:52:39');

The name of the chemist was Tu Youyou and the compound was Artemisinin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through turning to traditional medicine, the now Nobel Prize Laureate moved the proverbial needle in the fight against malaria and in the process saved millions of lives in Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Irene Chege&rsquo;s exploits in assessing the efficacy of key traditional medicine components in management of Type 2 Diabetes draws some parallels. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both women embarked on a brave journey to take an &ldquo;outside of the box&rdquo; approach to find solutions for diseases that have historically claimed millions of lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today as we mark The&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.afro.who.int/regional-director/speeches-messages/african-traditional-medicine-day-2022\" target=\"_blank\">African Traditional Medicines Day</a></strong>, we look at Dr. Irene&rsquo;s perspectives in relation to the contribution of traditional medicines to conventional medicine including safety and efficacy concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the current patient centered approach to therapy, do you think there is space for traditional medicines? Can they replace conventional medicines?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably not replace, but traditional medicines can definitely be integrated into conventional practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For that to happen though, there first needs to be extensive evidence-based research on the traditional medicines in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And thereafter proper capacity building done for all health care cadres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I can&rsquo;t completely discredit and say, &lsquo;traditional medicines should not be used for patients.&rsquo; If the training is there and adequate research has taken place, it&rsquo;s something that probably could be beneficial to patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have done extensive studies around traditional medicine and herbal formulations. One in particular that stands out for me is the one whose objective was to determine the safety and effectiveness of local herbal medicines used in the management of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. What herbal medicines were these and what were your key findings?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obviously due to confidentiality agreements I can&rsquo;t share exactly which herbal medicines or formulations were included in the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, what I can do say is that we included 3 herbalists in the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first one ended up dropping out of the study almost immediately as he was not comfortable revealing the contents of his mixtures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second herbalist provided the individual contents of his concoction but in my analysis, there was no evidence of glucose lowering effect. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third herbalist also provided individual contents of his mixture and on examination there were indeed signs of pharmacological action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How were you sure about the source of these ingredients?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were all freshly harvested individual ingredients from the forests. Mixing and processing were all done in the confines of the university.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My supervisors and I, and of course the herbalists were the only ones privy to the exact ingredients used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are there any safety related issues that came up?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Nods] Yes, there were 2 extremes;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One herbal formulation had such pronounced blood glucose reducing effect that some patients would go into hypoglycemia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second had absolutely no effect and therefore patients experienced treatment failure. It goes without saying that we had to stop in this cohort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember before conducting in humans, I had to do animal studies, where I harvested and examined key organ tissues for any adverse reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I weighed the organs, studied their histology and made specific conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message was consistent, even in animals there were some safety concerns, particularly with hypoglycemia. So, the element of dosing accuracy came into question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just also to mention, some patients included in the study had such deep-rooted beliefs on efficacy of the herbal medicines they were taking that they did not bother to monitor their glucose levels. This obviously was a mistake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other patients were also taking both traditional and conventional medicines simultaneously with the thinking that this strategy would maximize efficacy. This also brought up issues of drug-drug/food-drug interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did the patients tell you how they came about taking herbal medicines? Were they for example influenced by anyone?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firstly, some patients had turned to traditional medicines since they lacked trust in the safety of conventional medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They had the belief that there was an inherent risk in taking conventional medicines especially for extended periods of time. The potential &lsquo;side effects&rsquo; of these medicines had created fear in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, there was influence from testimonies from friends and fellow patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, I remember a patient who kept claiming that she was completely cured from diabetes attributing this to the concoctions she was taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interesting thing was that we followed her up for some time and she actually appeared to have normal blood sugars. (Laughs)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third was desperation. Some patients were at a point where they were willing to try whatever was out there to have their condition &lsquo;cured.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just to be clear, I think it&rsquo;s quite risky to stop standard treatment without consulting your doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>READ ALSO:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/dr-joyce-gikunda-the-pharmacist-who-dared-to-dream-of-beauty/\">Dr. Joyce Gikunda: The pharmacist who dared to dream of beauty (africanpharmaceuticalreview.com)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>There are 34 research institutes in 26 countries in Africa dedicated to traditional medicine research and development. Seeing you have done extensive research in this field. What do you find as the biggest challenges with respect to research on traditional medicines?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the biggest challenge is lack of information sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbalists are extremely secretive with their formulations and rightfully so because some confided to me that previously their &lsquo;discoveries&rsquo; had been &lsquo;taken over&rsquo; by large research institutions without being adequately credited or compensated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the only reason they agreed to share with me was because of the rapport they had with my supervisors; Prof. Faith Okalebo and Prof. Anastacia Guantai from The University of Nairobi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about funding?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were grants available, I mean I received one. However, in my experience, this type of research is extremely costly. So, despite getting a grant to conduct the study, I also had to dip into my own pockets to fund a huge part of the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why so costly?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sheer number of people that need to be involved in the study is enormous; botanists, herbalists, doctors, nurses, pharmacy team, laboratory technicians. It was overwhelming but worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Field travel and laboratory related costs were also quite high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well, what you need to understand is that one herbalist&rsquo;s mixture may content a series of ingredients which all have to be individually analyzed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, in my study one of the concoctions had seven ingredients which I had to examine one by one. That takes money. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And ethical approvals, did you experience any road blocks there?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would not call them road blocks, let&rsquo;s just say the ethics approval process was extremely rigorous and therefore time consuming. Which is completely understandable since my study involved use of both animal and human subjects. This obviously elicits quite a number of ethical issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, I had to submit all standard operating procedures for all activities I was going to undertake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a bit of back and forth but fortunately in the end I got the necessary approvals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Quality, safety and efficacy is key when it comes to all types of medicines. When I look at the cGMP, the standards are quite high. &nbsp;What is your opinion on traditional medicine, specifically those manufactured by herbalists (I am aware some herbalists are doing encapsulation)? Should they be subjected to the same standards as conventional medicines?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think all facilities &lsquo;manufacturing&rsquo; traditional medicines should be cGMP compliant. After all, they are still being consumed by humans and some have been proven to have pharmacological action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For safety purposes I believe it is important to be compliant to international standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly to penetrate foreign markets with these products it is important that they are manufactured with the highest level of quality. As we know, Europe in particular is quite strict on quality when it comes to all types of health products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personally, I believe these products need to be at the standard of conventional medicines if not better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WHO also stated that as of last year, 30 countries have integrated traditional medicine into their national policies and 39 countries have established regulatory frameworks for traditional medicine practitioners, compared to only one in 2000. &nbsp;Why do you think it has taken over 2 decades for this to happen and why do you think some countries are reluctant to do the same?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think some of the countries have not understood the importance of traditional medicines and don&rsquo;t have a good rapport with the herbalists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s only through these relationships that the field can be developed and cemented through policies and regulations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since it is a growing sector, may be the regulatory bodies should charge subsidized fees when it comes to registration and quality control tests so that these products are not locked out due to costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These institutions may also be lacking capacity to regulate traditional medicine products so capacity building has to take place</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also an inherent fear of biopiracy, so the herbalists are fearful to approach the regulatory bodies as they lack intellectual property (IP) protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Currently 17 countries, as opposed to zero in 2000, have frameworks for the protection of intellectual property rights and traditional medical knowledge. Clearly there is still room for improvement but what are some of the IP related challenges in traditional medicine that probably inhibit progression in the field?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is virtually impossible to gain IP rights for a plant. This is nature and therefore doesn&rsquo;t qualify for protection. However, for a processed final product that can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my view intellectual protection should be done in the institutions of learning. Herbalists should bring their products to these institutions and immediately a contract is drawn up that covers both parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After extensive studies have taken place and product provides repeatable findings, then I believe they should be compensated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think the herbalists should own a considerable amount of IP rights however bulk of it should remain with the universities. I believe it is the universities who have the funds, equipment and scientific talent to see these kinds of projects through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important aspect to mention is that herbalists are dying with information they have collected for decades. I think its important for knowledge to be shared however the IP agreements need to be conceivably fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In your view, could there be opportunities for pharmacists to explore in this field?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe if you have a keen interest in research, this is an area you can thrive particularly if you align yourself with a learning institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there are many herbals and herbal components, the key is to narrow down on specific ingredients and carry out targeted studies on the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, pharmacists can identify medicinal and aromatic plants that have documented pharmacological action and engage in large-scale cultivation. This could be commercially lucrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that works for animals as well. There are animals that have shown promise in traditional medicine therapies. They can also create a niche for themselves through this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What partnerships do you think are key to harnessing the full benefits of traditional medicine?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost; Universities and other learning institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from providing the infrastructure and equipment to do the research, creating awareness to health care students could propel the sector forward. For example, in our University, complementary medicine has been integrated into the syllabus for Medicine students. This can also be cascaded to nursing, dental and other health related courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second is regulatory bodies. National drug regulatory agencies need to work closely with key stakeholders including herbalists to develop standards and guidelines in ensuring the products are safe, efficacious and of good quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third is funding groups. If more funds can be pumped into research on traditional medicines, I believe the growth of the sector will be expedited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your advice to patients, particularly those with chronic illnesses and are taking or thinking about starting to take herbal medicines to manage their conditions?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think with the current frameworks as they are and paucity of data, it is extremely risky to take herbal medicines to manage chronic conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, imagine if a diabetic patient in the deep ends of a village, resolves to manage their condition with unregistered herbal products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If these products are ineffective, this patient will end up with diabetic complications and eventually death. There could also be issues of undocumented adverse drug reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All therapy has to be backed by evidence-based research and supervised by a trained healthcare professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do you plan to commemorate African Traditional Medicine Day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Laughs]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You know the funny thing is, as a family [especially mum], we have always been huge fans of herbal therapies in management of minor symptoms such as sore throats, coughs and colds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the kitchen you will rarely miss honey, turmeric, lemons, ginger and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I will probably call and inform them about the day and see hopefully how we can commemorate the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you find this interview informative?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\">Subscribe</a></p>', '1', '10', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Blue-Modern-Tips-Business-Banner-7-1536x768.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-20 03:55:02', '2024-06-20 03:55:02'),

How were you able to achieve such high levels of education under those circumstances?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My late dad. I attribute all of it to him and my mum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God blessed me and my siblings with extraordinary parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They never saw us as girls or boys. We were just children. Children who needed to be given the best platform to succeed. But, with that platform came tremendous expectation for excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The life sciences have historically been a male-dominated field, how has your experience been over the years?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Laughs) Growing up, I was oblivious of the challenges women faced while pursuing a professional career. It was only when I joined campus that I was confronted with the concept of minimization of women&rsquo;s achievements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I felt extremely disadvantaged as a woman and it was not nice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I had the realization and made a vow that as a woman, I had to work four times as hard as my male counterparts to make it virtually impossible to be ignored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Prof Faith Okalebo\" src=\"https://africanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SOP-1024x768.jpg\" style=\"height:561px; width:749px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School of Pharmacy, University of Nairobi (credit: University of Nairobi)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The history of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pharmacy.uonbi.ac.ke/\" target=\"_blank\">School of Pharmacy</a>&nbsp;at the University of Nairobi can be traced back to the 70s. You joined the school as an undergraduate in 1989, Masters student in 2001 and then as a lecturer for over 25 years. How do you think the curriculum has evolved to suit the new trends of the pharmacy profession?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has changed a lot. I mean, there were units that were literally nonexistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before I joined as an undergraduate student, for instance, pharmacy management and clinical pharmacy were not in the curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my opinion the students at the time graduated handicapped in a crucial set of skills which I believe they needed to succeed. I am happy that changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, I once attended a workshop where it was stated that in the public sector, among medical professionals, pharmacists have statistically been found to be the best managers (in health facilities and programs). I don&rsquo;t think it is a coincidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB), being the key regulator in the practice of pharmacy Kenya, have they had any influence on this curriculum evolution?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, the PPB has recently come up with a quite ambitious draft curriculum for universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their proposal is to officially introduce courses such as Pharmacovigilance and Research Methodology in the undergraduate coursework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My only concern is that the course work may prove too heavy for the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What would you recommend?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I believe there should be a greater focus on exponential learning where students are taught largely through hands-on experience and reflection rather than through abstract theories and concepts. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, introduction of tracks (specializations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can borrow a leaf from our Bachelor of Commerce counterparts who are able to choose a specialization or tracks in the early stages of their program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In my experience there are undergraduate students who have minimal interest in clinical aspects, some are more inclined towards pharmacy business while others in research and manufacturing. Why not facilitate this?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do key stakeholders in the continent think?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The African Union for example, developed and proposed a pharmacy undergraduate curriculum that was geared at accelerating developmental drug manufacturing capacity in Africa. It is radically different from our current program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a good proposal especially with the long-term goal of making the continent self-sustainable in regards to medicine supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However local capacity needs to be improved first before such a curriculum can be implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You had a stint as a company pharmacist, a retail pharmacist, and then as a hospital pharmacist (in one of the biggest hospitals in Kenya). It seems though you found a home in academia. &nbsp;Why academia?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Laughs) In my time, the role of the pharmacist was not as expansive as it is now. The options were extremely narrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convention was you either become a retail or hospital pharmacist. That was my mindset at the time. Thinking about it, it&rsquo;s true what they say, &ldquo;you are truly limited by your environment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I enjoyed my time working in KAM pharmacy (retail) but I never truly felt professionally satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working at Aga Khan, though a great learning experience and a nice pay check, I still felt that I was in a place where I was not deriving satisfaction and happiness. That bred huge frustration and I knew I had to do something about it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I prayed deeply for a miracle and this bore fruit through a UON advertisement for a tutorial fellow. With zero hesitation I applied and I have never looked back since. 25 years later I believe it is the best decision I ever made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In the last couple of years pharmacists have been struggling to get employment. What would your advice be to unemployed pharmacists and high school students who probably are thinking of joining the program, but they&rsquo;re unsure due to that lack of job security.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Sighs) It pains my heart but they should not lose hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, there are now opportunities to venture abroad and there are agencies that specialize in facilitating these moves. A lot of health professionals are now looking at countries like Australia, Canada and even the UK for work opportunities. My projection is that in a few years, Africa will be the source of manpower for the more developed countries in the health domains. It is unfortunate that a country can train pharmacists only for them to seek greener pastures in developed countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, our pharmacists can focus on entrepreneurship and innovation. For example, I&rsquo;ve seen many of our graduates establishing companies that focus on drug importation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;In Nigeria, I noted that they are now teaching innovation and entrepreneurship to pharmacists something I think we should add into our curriculum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Nigerian pharmacy graduates have set up fertility clinics while others are manufacturing APIs (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) for antibiotics in West Africa. So it can be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly there are atypical areas that pharmacists can venture into.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;I know of two pharmacists; one is thriving in data science while the other in supplies management in a logistics firm. Roles you wouldn&rsquo;t typically associate with the profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I have had experience being your student both in undergraduate and Master&rsquo;s programs. And to me (and to some of your former students), one thing that stands out is your humility and supportive nature in your approach to teaching and mentorship. What keeps you grounded despite your achievements and accolades?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Laughs)Wow thank you for the compliment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three things keep me grounded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One is my late father; he was the epitome of humility despite his extraordinary academic achievements. I mean he went out of his way to serve, way beyond his call of duty and that left a great impression on me. It was a true example on how to treat people and live a meaningful life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second is my religion. The Catholic church, emphasize that the greatest prayer that one can give to God is serving with dedication, humility, love, and excellence. Some Christians divorce what they do as people, from prayer. There is such a great divide. but for me if you serve well, that is a prayer to God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thirdly I have had experience in some offices where I didn&rsquo;t feel I was served with dignity. It is quite demoralizing and demeaning. I made a vow that I would be different. I therefore always try to make a pleasant experience for not only my students, but those who I interact with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What kind of legacy would you like to leave behind?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Sighs) That&rsquo;s a tough question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Pauses)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I would like to be remembered for the impact that I have made in academia. Both as a lecturer and researcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;It is fair to say that I have devoted most of my life to academia. And honestly, my greatest contribution has been in development, implementation and sustenance of postgraduate programs within the School of Pharmacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tanzania is in the process of implementing a course on Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance, a program I have coordinated for years. They say if somebody imitates you, that is the highest form of praise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is what I hope my legacy will be.</p>', '1', '12', 'https://africanpharmaceuticalreviewbucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/blogs/Blue-Modern-Tips-Business-Banner-2-1536x768.jpg', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '2024-06-20 03:59:31', '2024-06-20 03:59:31');
